""If you must know more, his name is Beorn. He is very strong, and he is a skin-changer.""
—Gandalf the Grey[1]

Beorn was a Northman, skin-changer, and a Beorning chieftain who lived near the river Anduin between Mirkwood and the Misty Mountains. His kin had lived in that region during the last centuries of the Third Age, guarding the Ford of Carrock from the Goblins and Wargs.[1]

 Biography 
 Third Age 
Beorn was a warrior with great strength who could turn into a great black bear. In human form he was a tall, black-haired man with huge arms and a great beard. Beorn kept many animals at his residence, such as horses, dogs and sheep. His animals were all extremely intelligent; his dogs, for instance, could walk on their hind legs while carrying things with their forelegs, set the table, and able to speak. Beorn's horses could also understand what their master said. Beorn was also capable of speaking in the tongue of beasts, as he could communicate with bears. When he spoke to his dogs, his words sounded like ""barks twisted into some form of speech"".[1]

 Quest of Erebor 
In the year TA 2941, Beorn granted shelter to Thorin and Company, which included Gandalf and the hobbit Bilbo Baggins. Beorn, though not over fond of dwarves, provided the company with food, supplies, and guidance after being humored by Gandalf's telling of the company's story. The company then left Beorn to travel through Mirkwood, though the Beorning warned them not to drink from the Enchanted stream within the forest.[1]
Some months later, word came to Beorn of impending trouble at the Lonely Mountain, and he arrived in time to take part in the Battle of Five Armies, where he bore Thorin from the battlefield after the dwarf was mortally wounded. Beorn later accompanied Gandalf and Bilbo on their return journey as far as his home, where he allowed the two to stay over the winter.[2]

 Later years 
In the years following the Battle of Five Armies, Beorn became a great chieftain among the folk of the Anduin Vales and his followers became known as the Beornings. At some point he became the father of Grimbeorn, later known as Grimbeorn the Old. Before the War of the Ring, Beorn passed away,[3] and his son Grimbeorn took over his duties as chieftain.[4]

Etymology
The name Beorn originates from an Old English term that means ""warrior"". It is a homophone of Old Norse bjǫrn which means ""bear"".[5]

 Character 
Despite being incredibly powerful, Beorn respected all life forms, with the exceptions of Goblins and Wargs, due to their malevolent and destructive tendencies. He had a magic-like effect on his animals, who seem more intelligent and strong than other animals. He kept bee pastures and spent his nights patrolling the woods and mountains in the form of a bear. He was wise and powerful, possessing incredible strength and durability. He was fairly decent, allowing Thorin and Company to stay at his home for a short while, offering sanctuary from the Goblins. Beorn was also vengeful; when Thorin was fatally wounded in battle Beorn stormed the Goblin ranks, rescues Thorin and then returns, destroying the Goblins and killing Bolg himself.

 Portrayal in adaptations 
 The Hobbit film trilogy 
    Beorn portrayed in his human form  
Beorn is portrayed by Mikael Persbrandt in the films The Desolation of Smaug and The Battle of the Five Armies. His appearance in the films is quite different than his description in the book and portrayals in other media. In the films, he has greyish-brown hair, a forked beard, shackles on his left arm, and a mane of hair growing as a ridge down the length of his back. Beorn mentioned his fellow Shape Shifters, who once lived in the mountains before Azog the Defiler came down from the north and killed or enslaved many of his people for sport. Beorn escaped the terrible fate of his kin (explaining the shackles on his arm), and claims that he is the last of his kind. He gives them horses to reach Mirkwood and provides escort to protect them from roaming Orcs. Beorn appears to be aware of the dark presence in Dol Guldur as he knows of an alliance between the Orcs of Moria and the Necromancer, whom he calls the Sorcerer, in Dol Guldur. Packs of Orcs have been seen gathering in the fortress with their numbers increasing every day. Beorn also knows that the Necromancer is not what he seems to be and that dark and foul things are drawn to his power, not to mention Azog's allegiance to him. He also heard word spread of the dead rising and walking near the High Fells of Rhudaur. He asked Gandalf if there actually were tombs in those mountains and Gandalf confirms the tombs as Beorn remembered a time when a great evil ruled the lands and had the power to raise the dead. If that evil had returned, he wished to know from Gandalf.
In The Battle of the Five Armies, he makes a brief cameo during the battle, shifting from man to bear form as he arrives with the Great Eagles, attacking several goblins and wargs. He is later seen at the funeral for Thorin, Fili and Kili.

    Beorn watches Azog's forces.  
Beorn's personality is notably different from what it is in the book. Instead of being boisterous and impatient, Beorn is depicted as soft-spoken and collected. Beorn is also said to be in little control of himself in the The Desolation of Smaug, but in the book, he can be tame and gentle as a bear, even following the Dwarves to ensure the return of his ponies when the Dwarves leave his house to go to Mirkwood.

 Trivia 




Lists of miscellaneous information should be avoided. Please relocate any relevant information into appropriate sections or articles.



In the early film concepts, Beorn's bear form was rather monstrous, looking more like a Troll or Orc.
In The Desolation of Smaug Beorn states that he ""remembers"" Sauron's heyday, four hundred years ago. His wording makes it unclear whether he lived during that time or if his people passed down stories of the Dark Lord's reign.
 At one point in film development, Beorn was intended to play a part in the Dol Guldur story-line, as speculated from his appearance in a LEGO set, 79011 ""Dol Guldur Ambush"".
Björn Kurtén was famous for his studies on Cave Bears, very large, extinct bear species. Interestingly, his name Bjorn is identical to the etymology of Beorn's name noted above.

Melkor (Quenya; IPA: ""He who arises in might""), later known predominantly as Morgoth (Sindarin; IPA: ""Black Foe of the World"")[1], was the first Dark Lord, and the primordial source of evil in Eä.
Originally the most powerful of the Ainur created by Eru Ilúvatar, Melkor rebelled against his creator out of pride and sought to corrupt Arda. After committing many evils in the First Age, such as the theft of the Silmarils, which resulted in his name Morgoth, and the destruction of the Two Lamps and the Two Trees of Valinor, Morgoth was defeated by the Host of Valinor in the War of Wrath. As punishment he was cast out of Arda into the Void, though it was prophesied he would one day return.

 Biography 
 Ainulindalë 
Melkor was created by Eru Ilúvatar in the Timeless Halls at the beginning of creation. His brother was Manwë, though Melkor was greater in power and knowledge than any of the Ainur.[2]
Impatient with the emptiness of the Great Void outside the Timeless Halls, and desiring to create things of his own, Melkor often went forth into the Void in search of the Flame Imperishable. But the Flame was of Ilúvatar and resided with him, and Melkor never discovered it. He continued to search, however, and as such was often alone and apart from his fellow Ainur. It was during these lonesome periods that Melkor began to have ideas and thoughts of his own that were not in accordance with his fellow Ainur.

    Melkor (front left) weaves his music with Eru's  
When the Ainur sang the Great Music before Eru, Melkor wove some of these alien thoughts into his music, and straightaway Discord arose around him. Some of those nearby attuned their music to his, until two musical themes were warring before the Throne. To correct the Discord, Eru introduced a Second, and then a Third Theme into the music. But Melkor succeeded in holding back the Second theme, of which Manwë was the chief instrument. The Third was the theme of Elves and Men, and while it was not overwhelmed by the Discord as the Second theme was, it too failed to correct it. When Eru brought the Music to an end, he rebuked Melkor, praising his strength but reminding him that, as an aspect of his creator's thought, anything that Melkor could bring into being ultimately had its source within Eru himself. As such, even the Discord redounded in the end to the glory of Eru's work. This rebuke shamed Melkor, but brought on anger in him as well, though he hid it. Thus when the Music was made incarnate as Arda, it was already flawed through the Discord, and immoderate heat and great cold stalked it. Melkor then took in the interest of the World and descended to it with the other Valar.

 Arrival in Arda 
When the Valar entered into Arda and began to shape the unwrought matter, Melkor saw the Field of Arda and claimed it for his own. However, the other Valar took Manwë to be their lord, for while Manwë was not nearly so powerful as Melkor, he understood the thought of Eru better than any of his peers. Bitter, Melkor set himself against the other Valar. Whenever the Valar worked to better the world, Melkor disrupted their efforts. For a long while, Melkor fought alone against the might of all the other Valar and Maiar of Arda, and he long held the upper hand. During this time, Arda was kept essentially shapeless, as Melkor ruined virtually every early work that the other Valar attempted to create. Fortunately for them, the mighty Valar Tulkas eventually descended to Arda, and his strength tipped the balance in favor of the Valar. Melkor fled before him, and left Arda for a time.

 Years of the Lamps 
After Melkor's departure, the Valar managed to quiet the tumults of the world, and set about ordering it in preparation for the coming of the Elves. To give light to the world, they constructed two Great Lamps in Middle-earth and set their place of dwelling in the midst of them. During this time, Melkor re-entered Arda with the various Maiar spirits who had attuned themselves to his music, and delved a mighty fortress at the very north-most part of the World and named it Utumno.[3] To defend it he raised the Mountains of the East in the northeast of Middle-earth, east of the Sea of Helcar. Decay arose in the North, and the Valar thus knew that Melkor had returned. Before they could begin to search for him however, Melkor came forth from Utumno with sudden war, and cast down the Lamps. The fire within the Lamps scorched a great portion of the world, and containing the catastrophe caused by their breaking kept the Valar occupied long enough for Melkor and his forces to retreat back to Utumno.
After the destruction of the Lamps, the Valar withdrew to the continent of Aman and there built Valinor. In doing so, however, they gave Melkor virtually free-reign in Middle-earth. As a result, the continent languished in darkness, and Melkor filled its lands with terrible creatures and decay. During this time, Melkor built his second, lesser fortress of Angband in the west, as a defense from the West should the Valar attack. Angband was delved into the Iron Mountains, and was given to Sauron to command.[4] While the Valar were unsure where the Children of Ilúvatar would awake, they were reluctant to wage war against Melkor, fearing the clash of powers might result in massive collateral damage the likes of which they had not seen since the Lamps were destroyed. As such, most of them remained in Aman and forsook Middle-earth. Due to this, Melkor discovered the Elves before the other Valar, captured many of them, and transformed them by torture and other foul craft into the first orcs in mockery of elves.

 Years of the Trees 
When it was discovered by the Vala Oromë where the Elves were, the Valar took immediate action against Melkor, instigating the War of the Powers. The Valar overcame the hosts of Melkor and he retreated into Utumno. After a grievous siege, the Valar rent the doors open and Melkor was captured. Melkor was bound with Angainor and brought back to Valinor. There, he pleaded for pardon, but was cast into the Halls of Mandos for three Ages. However, in their haste to overthrow Melkor, the Valar left many of Utumno's pits and vaults unexplored, and Sauron remained at large. Additionally, they did not capture or destroy the Balrogs, who gathered at the ruins of Angband and went into a long hibernation, awaiting Melkor's return.[4]
After the passing of the Ages, Melkor was brought before Manwë, and feigned repentance. Unable to comprehend the evil of Melkor, being himself free of it, Manwë ordered him released. At first, it seemed as though the evil of Melkor had been cured, for all who sought his counsel and aid in that time benefited greatly from it. However, Tulkas and Ulmo were both very slow to forget Melkor's evils, and watched him closely. In truth, Melkor was more filled with malice than ever, and began to put his extraordinary cunning to use in devising a way to ruin Aman. Seeing the bliss of the Elves and remembering that it was for their sake that he was overthrown, Melkor desired above all things to corrupt them. Of all the three primary groups of Elves, he found the Ñoldor to have a perfect balance of usefulness and open ears, and so worked his malice almost exclusively among them.

    Melkor, the first Dark Lord  
Over a long period of time he spread lies concerning the intentions of the Valar in bringing the Elves to Aman, telling them, among other things, tales of the coming of Men, the existence of which the Valar had not revealed to the Elves. Due to his carefully crafted lies, many of the Ñoldor began to believe that the Valar had brought them to Aman so that Men might inherit Middle-earth, taking the lands and the glory that could have been theirs. Eventually, a shadow fell upon the Ñoldor, and they began to openly rebel against the Valar. Chief amongst the disgruntled Ñoldor was Fëanor, the firstborn son of the Ñoldor King Finwë. Though he hated and feared Melkor, his overwhelming pride caused him to be the most vocal of the Ñoldor in expressing discontent. For their part, the Valar remained unaware of Melkor's work, and saw Fëanor as the source of the Ñoldor's unrest. Though perturbed, they let the situation continue until Fëanor threatened his brother Fingolfin with violence, at which point the Valar summoned him to the Ring of Doom in Valinor to explain his unlawful actions.
Fëanor's testimony revealed the lies of Melkor, and Tulkas immediately left the Ring of Doom to recapture him. But Melkor could not be found. After a time, Melkor went to Formenos and feigned friendship to Fëanor in order to acquire the Silmarils. But Fëanor, seeing Melkor's greed, refused him and shut the doors of Formenos in the face of Arda's mightiest being. Melkor then passed unseen to the south, and came upon Ungoliant. Promising to sate her unrelenting hunger, she and Melkor came back to Valinor, intending to destroy the Trees. Then, during a time of festival, Melkor and Ungoliant suddenly attacked. Melkor thrust a great spear into the Trees and Ungoliant drank the sap that poured from the wounds, draining the Trees and poisoning them. The Trees quickly withered and died, plunging Aman into complete darkness for a time.

    Melkor with Ungoliant  
In the fear and confusion that followed, Melkor sped to Formenos and broke into the fortress. There, he slew Finwë, father of Fëanor, and stole the Silmarils along with all the other gems that lay there. The Silmarils burned Melkor's hand, causing him immeasurable agony, but he did not release them. He and Ungoliant fled to the North, and the Valar gave chase, but the Unlight of Ungoliant bewildered them and the two escaped. The two thieves crossed the Grinding Ice of the Helcaraxë and entered into Middle-earth, completing Melkor's revenge.[1]
In Lammoth, Melkor and Ungoliant approached the ruins of Angband, with Melkor hoping to escape and leave his promise to feed Ungoliant unfulfilled. Ungoliant however, saw through his plan and stopped with him before they reached Angband. She demanded that he surrender the treasure of Formenos to sate her hunger as he had promised, and begrudgingly he gave her the lesser treasures he had taken, but he would not give her the Silmarils which lay hidden within his right hand. With his refusal to surrender the Silmarils, Ungoliant attacked Melkor, weaving her dark webbing about him. His resulting cry of pain and anguish roused the Balrogs from their slumber in the darkest depths of Angband. With a tempest of fire they came to his aid, and drove away Ungoliant, but Melkor recalled them, and thus Ungoliant escaped. He then began to rebuild Angband, and to gather his servants there.[1]
When Fëanor found his father was slain, he cursed Melkor and named him Morgoth, meaning ""Dark Enemy"", and by that name was he known ever after. The name Melkor was never spoken again by his enemies.
As Morgoth finished rebuilding Angband, the slag and debris created by his vast tunnelings was plied into three huge volcanoes, collectively known as Thangorodrim. He hastened then to rebuild his forces, breeding innumerable Orcs and other fell beasts.

 First Age 
 In Beleriand 
    The peaks of Thangorodrim  
Fëanor followed Morgoth to Middle-earth with the greater part of the Ñoldor in rebellion, hoping to recover the Silmarils. This action triggered the tragic War of the Great Jewels, in which the elves would be utterly defeated in the end.
Upon learning of the arrival of the Ñoldor in Middle-earth, Morgoth sent armies of orcs against Fëanor's host, hoping to destroy them before they could establish any viable defenses. Though the Ñoldor were outnumbered, they swiftly and completely destroyed the orcs; only a handful returned to Angband. But Fëanor, in his pride and arrogance, thought to come at Morgoth himself and pursued them. Soon, he and his vanguard drew far ahead of the main host, and the orcs, seeing this, turned and gave battle at the gates of Angband. Due to their proximity to Angband, a number of Balrogs emerged to aid the orcs, and the elves with Fëanor were quickly killed. Fëanor fought on alone, but was eventually struck down by Gothmog, the Lord of the Balrogs. Though a relief force under the command of his sons saved him from being killed on the field of battle, Fëanor's wounds were mortal and he perished soon after.[5]
Shortly after Fëanor's death, Morgoth sent an embassy to the Ñoldor offering terms of surrender, even promising a Silmaril. Maedhros agreed to the parley, but both sides, expecting treachery, came with greater force than was agreed. Unfortunately for the Elves, Morgoth's force was the greater of the two, and was accompanied by Balrogs. The Elven company was quickly slain with the exception of Maedhros, who was captured and chained by his right hand to one of Thangorodrim's many cliffs.[5] Morgoth sent word to the Ñoldor, promising to release Maedhros on the condition that the Elves would depart from the North and cease their war against him. However, the Elves knew that Morgoth would not honor his word, and sent no reply.

    Melkor's appearance as dark lord  
It was at this time that the host of Fingolfin, which had been betrayed and abandoned by Fëanor's host in Aman, came at last to Middle-earth. Tension between the two hosts quickly developed and Morgoth, seeing that the Ñoldor were divided, made plans to destroy his distracted foes. To his dismay however, the Valar revealed the creation of the Sun and the Moon, which confounded Morgoth and his servants for a time. To counter these new lights, Morgoth sent up nigh-impenetrable clouds of smoke from the Iron Mountains to darken Hithlum.
During the time of confusion and inaction among Morgoth's forces by these new lights, Fingon traveled to Angband, aided by the very darkness Morgoth had set upon Hithlum, and rescued Maedhros. In doing so, he set into motion a series of events that united the Ñoldor and allowed them to establish mighty kingdoms in Beleriand and Hithlum. When Morgoth initiated his next offensive, the Ñoldor swiftly and completely destroyed his forces and set a siege upon Angband, hoping to forever contain the evil of Morgoth. When he had waited many years, Morgoth made trial of his foes, causing the Iron Mountains to erupt and sending an army of orcs down through the passes, but to no avail, for the orcs were easily defeated by the Ñoldor. After this failure, Morgoth took to capturing what elves he could, breaking them with the power of his will and chaining their lives to his. These Elves became his spies among the Ñoldor, and they kept him appraised of the movements and plans of his enemies.

    The burning of Ard-galen at the beginning of the battle, by Filat  
One hundred years later, Morgoth sent an army into the north to approach Hithlum from the side, but an army under the command of Fingon destroyed them yet again. At this point, Morgoth came to realize that the orcs unaided were no match for the Ñoldor, and began experimenting with ways to create deadlier creatures for his armies. Another century passed, and the issuing of the first dragon, Glaurung, demonstrated the results of Morgoth's long labor. Glaurung's sudden appearance scattered the elves in the immediate vicinity of Angband, but a company of archers under Fingon's command engaged him before he could do much more than frighten the elves. As Glaurung was barely half-grown, his hide was not yet invulnerable to the elven arrows and he fled the field. Morgoth was displeased with Glaurung for revealing himself before his creator had planned, but ultimately Glaurung's youthful foray was of little consequence.[5]
Some time later, when men first arrived in Beleriand, it was revealed that Morgoth had left Angband and walked among the fathers of men. Hoping to corrupt them to his service, he spread his lies among them, and found them to be considerably easier to sway than the elves had been. However, the strengthening of the elven kingdoms worried Morgoth, and he returned to Angband before his labors were complete. Nevertheless, most Men believed or half-believed his lies and either departed from the North or joined with Morgoth's forces. However, a small group of men that became known as the Edain resisted him.[6] They provided the elves with vital intelligence as to the doings of Morgoth in the North, as many of their hardiest chose to live within sight of Angband's gates.

 Dagor Bragollach 
About 455 years after Fingolfin came to Middle-earth, Morgoth deemed that the time was ripe to destroy the elves and their allies. One cold winter night, when the elven watch was least vigilant, Morgoth sent forth terrible rivers of fire and lava from Thangorodrim and poisonous fumes from the Iron Mountains. The Elves were completely unprepared for such an assault, and a great many Ñoldor perished on the Ard-galen, as the fires consumed it and transformed it into a lifeless wasteland, forever after known as the Anfauglith. In the wake of these fires there came Glaurung, now fully grown, the Balrogs, and armies of orcs and other monsters in numbers such as the elves had never conceived of. Thus began the Dagor Bragollach. The Siege of Angband was swiftly broken and the forces of the elves were scattered. So swift and overwhelming was Morgoth's assault that the various elven kingdoms were unable to marshal their forces in any sort of unified front, and as such Morgoth was able to engage the elven forces in a piecemeal fashion, greatly blunting the effectiveness of any resistance.

    Morgoth in battle with Fingolfin  
With the exception of Maedhros and his fortress upon the Hill of Himring, the sons of Fëanor and Finarfin were overthrown and utterly defeated. Fingolfin and Fingon only just barely managed to defend Hithlum from Morgoth's onslaught, as the mountains surrounding it provided an effective barrier against Morgoth's fires. The elves were completely driven from the forests of Dorthonion, and many of the grey elves forsook the war altogether and went to Doriath. When news came to Fingolfin of the totality of the disasters that had befallen the elven forces, a great despair came upon him. Believing the Ñoldor to have been defeated beyond any hope of recovery, he rode forth alone from Hithlum to the gates of Angband in a wrath so potent that he was said to have resembled Oromë himself. When he arrived, he smote upon the doors of Morgoth's fortress, challenging the Dark Lord to come forth to single combat. Though Morgoth did not wish to, Fingolfin's challenge was heard by all in Angband, and was given in such an insulting manner that to ignore it would have been to lose face before his captains.[7]
Morgoth issued forth in black armor from Angband to confront Fingolfin. Wielding the terrible hammer Grond, Morgoth repeatedly attempted to smite the elven king, but succeeded only in carving many fiery pits in the ground from his missed strikes. Fingolfin long managed to avoid Morgoth's blows, and wounded the Dark Lord seven times. But at last, Fingolfin grew weary, and Morgoth thrice drove him to his knees. Fingolfin arose each time to continue the fight, but eventually he fell backwards into one of the many pits formed by Morgoth's missed attacks. Morgoth then set his foot upon Fingolfin's neck and killed him, but not before Fingolfin, with his last stroke, hewed Morgoth's foot with his sword. Then Morgoth broke the elf's body and prepared to feed it to his wolves. But Thorondor, the King of the Eagles, swooped down upon Morgoth, marring his face with his talons, and rescued the body of the elf-king.[7]
Fingolfin's last stroke gave Morgoth a permanent limp, and the pain of his seven wounds could not be healed, nor were the scars ever erased.

    Morgoth and Fingolfin, by Ted Nasmith  
However, despite his great victory, Morgoth had made a critical mistake. So great had been his malice and his desire to destroy the elves that he had struck before his plans were fully realized, and in his hatred and contempt he had underestimated the resolve and valor of his foes. Now Morgoth found that the elves and Edain, recovering from the initial shock of his onslaught, had begun to make small gains against his outlying forces. He therefore checked his advance, and withdrew the main host of the orcs to Angband. For though he knew that his victory had been relatively decisive, his own losses had been as numerous as the losses that had been accrued by the elves. Afterwards, Morgoth sent out many spies, and he sent messengers to men, feigning pity. When the Edain refused his false offers of peace, he summoned the Easterlings over the Blue Mountains to harass them militarily. Seven years passed before Morgoth renewed his offensive. He assailed Hithlum with great strength but just as he was on the verge of victory, Círdan and a host under his command came at the last moment and helped Fingon to turn the orcs back.

 The Quest of the Silmaril 
Some time later, the elven-maiden Lúthien and her human lover Beren, seeking to recover a Silmaril, came disguised to Morgoth's court. Morgoth was able to see through her disguise, but she was undaunted by his eyes, and offered to sing for him. As she sang, Morgoth conceived a lust and an evil more abominable than any he had yet committed, and allowed her to continue singing. But as he delighted in his thought, suddenly shadow hid her, and she sang a song of great and terrible power that cast a spell of sleep.[8]

    Lúthien and Morgoth  
All Morgoth's court was cast down in slumber by her song, but the Silmarils burned, and became so heavy that the head of Morgoth sagged upon his chest. He fell from his throne, the Iron Crown rolled away from him, and Beren cut a Silmaril from it. However, rather than leaving immediately with his prize, he tried to take another of the Silmarils. As he attempted to pry the second jewel loose, his knife snapped. One shard struck Morgoth's face, and he began to awaken. Beren and Lúthien fled in terror, but were not chased as Morgoth and his court had not yet woke. However, at the gates of Angband the werewolf Carcharoth was aware of them, and later bit off Beren's hand, and took with it the Silmaril. Burning from the inside at the touch of the holy jewel, Carcharoth went mad and fled in wrath from Angband, slaughtering all who stood in his path. Then Morgoth awoke, and in a rage he and his court roared up in pursuit, only to see Thorondor carrying off the raiders. Morgoth's rage at the loss of the Silmaril caused the Iron Mountains to begin erupting, terrifying all those who could see it. Ultimately however, he was unable to recover the gem.[7]

 Nirnaeth Arnoediad 
Soon after, Morgoth became aware that Maedhros was making a great league against him, and driving his orcs off the northern heights. As such, he took council against them and prepared his forces for a major confrontation. When the elves eventually made it to Angband, the Battle of Nirnaeth Arnoediad began. Ultimately, the battle was a complete and decisive victory for Morgoth. The power of the elves and their Edain compatriots to make war against Morgoth was utterly and permanently broken. All of the great kingdoms of the Ñoldor in Beleriand besides Gondolin, were destroyed, and Hithlum was at last taken as well. The Edain who did not flee were enslaved by Easterlings, and Húrin was taken captive.[9]

 The Cursing of Húrin 
Morgoth was also well known for the imprisonment of Húrin of the House of Hador during the Nirnaeth Arnoediad. In the last hours of the battle, Húrin and his kin defended Turgon, for he was the last heir to the thrones of Gondolin and Fingolfin after his brother Fingon fell in battle. Turgon narrowly escaped the clutches of the host of orcs due to the valor of Húrin, Huor, and their men.
Unfortunately, all but Húrin fell after the onslaught of Morgoth's forces. After slaying untold numbers of trolls and orcs single-handedly, Húrin was captured by Gothmog and taken to Angband. Morgoth knew that Húrin had been to Gondolin, and therefore knew the city's location. He sought to extract the information from him but, despite inflicting terrible torment upon his captive, he was unsuccessful. 

    Morgoth sentences Húrin, by Ted Nasmith  
From a distance Morgoth put the son and daughter of Húrin, Turin and Nienor, under a species of diabolic oppression: his thought followed them and gave them bad luck, though they were not possessed. By this means he drove them at last to madness and despair; though there is doubt as to whether in the extremity of his malice he cheated himself, as their madness saved them from damnation.[10]
Behold! The Shadow of my thought shall lie upon them wherever they go, and my hate shall pursue them to the ends of the world.—The Children of Húrin
Then, continuing his curse, he said:
But all whom you love my thought shall weigh as a cloud of Doom, and it shall bring them down into darkness and despair. Wherever they go, evil shall arise. Wherever they speak, their words shall bring ill counsel. Whatsoever they do shall turn against them. They shall die without hope, cursing both life and death.—The Children of Húrin","

Amroth was an Elven king of Lothlórien.
Although he was descended from the Sindarin Elves, Amroth was pleased to adopt the customs of the Galadhrim and to live in a high house on Cerin Amroth, a hill in Lothlórien.

Contents[show]
 Biography 
 Third Age 
When Amroth's father, Amdír, was killed during the Battle of Dagorlad in SA 3434, Amroth became the King of Lothlórien. He became the last of the ruling Sindar over Lorien.

 Amroth and Nimrodel 
Amroth's beloved, a beautiful Elf Maiden named Nimrodel, regretted that Elves from Beleriand, which was under assault by Morgoth, were being admitted into Lothlórien. She believed that these foreign Elves brought wars and destroyed the peace that Lothlórien's inhabitants had once enjoyed. When a Balrog was awakened in Moria by the delvings of the Dwarves and they fled north to the Grey Mountains, many of the Elves living on the west side of Lórien moved inward, and the Galadhrim tightened their guard. Nimrodel, living on the west side of the forest by the stream that afterward bore her name, preferring not to mix with the Galadhrim who she deemed invaders of the golden wood, instead fled to Fangorn Forest in TA 1981 (Third Age). Amroth followed her to the forest, which was much closer to Lothlórien than it later became. Upon attempting to enter the forest, Nimrodel was halted and badly frightened by the movements and murmurings of the Black Huorns who barred her entrance. She lingered on the edge of the forest, unsure of what to do. Amroth found her there a day later.
There, Amroth and Nimrodel spoke long and earnestly with one another, Amroth begging for her favor. Eventually, the Elf-Maiden promised that she would marry Amroth only if he brought her to a peaceful land.
Amroth vowed that he would leave the Elves of Lothlórien, even if a time came when they needed him most. However, none of Middle-earth was at peace and Amroth believed that the Elves would never enjoy peace again. He suggested that he and Nimrodel should travel across the Sundering Seas to the Undying Lands.
Amroth knew that the Sindarin Elves had come to the Bay of Belfalas, a haven south of Lothlórien, long ago. Although the majority of those elves had left Middle-earth and sailed to the Undying Lands, Amroth was aware that some of their kind still built ships and offered passage to any of the other elves wishing to leave Middle-earth. After Amroth made the necessary arrangements, he and Nimrodel left Lothlórien.
However, they somehow became separated on their journey. Amroth looked for Nimrodel, but his search was unsuccessful so he continued south towards the Sundering Seas.

 Fate 
At the havens on the Bay of Belfalas, Amroth found that the few remaining Sindarin Elves who remained in Middle-earth were preparing to leave aboard the only seaworthy ship that they had. Although they welcomed Amroth aboard, they were unwilling to wait for Nimrodel. They hoped that she was in Gondor and that she had not attempted to cross the White Mountains, where many unfriendly Men and evil creatures lived.
The summer was almost over and it would soon be autumn, which was expected to bring dangerously strong winds. However, the Elves saw that Amroth was extremely upset. They had removed all their possessions from their houses on the shore, so they waited with Amroth on their ship for many weeks. Summer passed and autumn came, but Nimrodel still did not arrive.
One night, one of the fiercest storms in the recorded history of Gondor came from the Northern Waste, swept through Eriador and caused an enormous amount of destruction to Gondor. Many of the ships that the Men of Gondor had built were swept away from the coast and sank. The wind broke the light Elven-ship from its moorings and hurled the vessel far from the Bay of Belfalas, driving it towards the coasts of Umbar.
At dawn of the following morning, the storm dissipated. However, when Amroth awoke, he saw that the ship was already far from its port. Full of despair, Amroth screamed Nimrodel's name, threw himself into the water below and drowned.
The ship was never seen again in Middle-earth, although it is likely that the vessel left the Circles of the World and eventually reached Tol Eressëa, an island that the Eldar used to enable them to complete the Great Journey.
Neither Elves nor Men ever saw Amroth or Nimrodel again, but there were many legends concerning Nimrodel's fate.

 Legacy 
The Elf Maiden shared her name with a stream where she once lived, which indirectly flowed into the Bay of Belfalas. According to Elven legend, Amroth's voice continued to emanate from the sea and Nimrodel's voice often resonated from the stream that shared her name.[4][3]

 Etymology 
Amroth means ""upclimber"" or ""high climber"", from am (""high, going up"").[5] It refers to his having built and dwelt in a flet high in the trees on Cerin Amroth. The name was of Lemberin language (later ""Avarin""), along with other Sindarin names such as Legolas, Nimrodel, and Thranduil.[6]

Portrayal in adaptations
    Amroth in The Lord of the Rings Online  
In The Lord of the Rings Online Amroth appears during an extended flashback set during the Siege of Barad-dûr in the year S.A. 3440.

 Amroth in Song 
Legolas sang an extract from a long and sad song to Frodo Baggins by the banks of the Nimrodel. The song, which depicted the story of Amroth and Nimrodel, was sometimes sung in Rivendell.[4]


An Elven-maid there was of old,
A shining star by day:
Her mantle white was hemmed with gold,
Her shoes of silver-grey.

A star was bound upon her brows,
A light was on her hair
As sun upon the golden boughs
In Lórien the fair.

Her hair was long, her limbs were white,
And fair she was and free;
And in the wind she went as light
As leaf of linden-tree.

Beside the falls of Nimrodel,
By water clear and cool,
Her voice as falling silver fell
Into the shining pool.

Where now she wanders none can tell,
In sunlight or in shade;
For lost of yore was Nimrodel
And in the mountains strayed.

The elven-ship in haven grey
Beneath the mountain-lee
Awaited her for many a day
Beside the roaring sea.

A wind by night in Northern lands
Arose, and loud it cried,
And drove the ship from elven-strands
Across the streaming tide.

When dawn came dim the land was lost,
The mountains sinking grey
Beyond the heaving waves that tossed
Their plumes of blinding spray.

Amroth beheld the fading shore
Now low beyond the swell,
And cursed the faithless ship that bore
Him far from Nimrodel.

Of old he was an Elven-king,
A lord of tree and glen,
When golden were the boughs in spring
In fair Lothlórien.

From helm to sea they saw him leap,
As arrow from the string,
And dive into the water deep,
As mew upon the wing.

The wind was in his flowing hair,
The foam about him shone;
Afar they saw him strong and fair
Go riding like a swan.

But from the West has come no word,
And on the Hither Shore
No tidings Elven-folk have heard
Of Amroth evermore.


 Other versions of the legendarium 
Amroth was briefly the son of Galadriel and Celeborn, brother of Celebrían. In this version, he lived in Eregion and fled with Galadriel and Celebrían between TA 1350 and TA 1400.[3]
He was called as Ammalas in earlier writings, and was the lover of Inglorel (Nimrodel).[7]

Valar (Aratar)



Aulë (Quenya; IPA: [ˈaʊle] - ""Invention"") was an Ainu, one of the Aratar and a Vala, who was responsible for fashioning and crafting the substances of which Arda, the world, was composed. He was also called Mahal (Khuzdul; IPA: ""Maker""), Oli (Sindarin; IPA: ""Dream"") or Návatar and delights in the nature of substances and in works of skill, but not concerned with possession or mastery. Besides the shaping of Arda, Aulë's greatest works were the Two Lamps of the Valar, the vessels of the Sun and Moon, and the Dwarves, whom he created out of impatience for the Children of Ilúvatar. He also created Angainor (the chain of Melkor).

 Biography 
As Aulë was a smith, he was the Valar most similar in thought and powers to Melkor, in that they each gloried in the fashioning of artful and original things. Both also came to create beings of their own. But while Aulë strove to be true to the original intent of the Music of the Ainurs, and submitted all that he did to the will of Ilúvatar, Melkor wished to control and subvert all things, and was jealous of the creations of others so that he would try to twist or destroy all that they made. There was long strife between Aulë and Melkor both before and after the creation of Arda. Aulë, however, traditionally opposed attempts to fight Melkor, for fear of the damage that would be wrought to Arda.
When the Elves came to Valinor, the Ñoldor became the students of Aulë. Fëanor was his greatest pupil, and from him learned to make gems through craftsmanship that was later forgotten. This would eventually lead to the Silmarils, the greatest creation of handiwork within Arda. On the Flight of the Noldor, the Noldor who returned to Valinor under Finarfin named themselves the Aulendur, Followers of Aulë. Despite his lordly skill, Aulë was humble and compassionate, and indeed the Dwarves survived only because Aulë submitted them to the will of Ilúvatar. His spouse was Yavanna, with whom he dwelt in central Valinor.

 Creation of the Dwarves 
    Aulë prepares to destroy his children, by Ted Nasmith  
Desperate for pupils onto whom he could pass his knowledge, and unwilling to wait for the emergence of the Children of Ilúvatar, Aulë created his own race of beings, the dwarves. However, he did not have a clear idea of what the Children of Ilúvatar would be like, and because of the presence of the chaos caused by Melkor, Aulë made the Dwarves strong and unyielding, and not willing to endure the domination of others, as well as embodying some of his values and desires for Middle-earth. However Aulë did not have the power to give independent life to his creations, they could act only when his thought was on them.
When Aulë completed his work he began to instruct the Dwarves in a language he had made for them, Khuzdul. Then Ilúvatar spoke to Aulë, asking why he would seek to exceed his power and authority by attempting to make new life. Aulë repented, answering that the drive to create was kindled in him by Ilúvatar, and that he only wished for other beings to love and teach, with whom to share in the beauty of the world. He admitted that his impatience had driven him to folly and submitted his creations to Ilúvatar. Assuming that they should be destroyed, he made to smite the seven Fathers of the Dwarves with a great hammer.  As he raised the hammer the Dwarves shrank from the coming blow, but Ilúvatar stayed Aulë's hand and showed that he had accepted Aulë's offer by gifting the Dwarves with spirits of their own, else they could not have been afraid.
Ilúvatar accepted the Dwarves as his adopted children however, as it was ordained that the elves were to be the first-born race, Ilúvatar set the Dwarves to sleep until after the Awakening of the Elves. He told Aulë that while both were his children, their creation was outside the scope of the Music of the Ainur, and strife would arise between the Dwarven race and the Elven race as the events of the world unfolded. The Dwarves believe that after they die their spirits move to halls that Aulë has set aside for them alone, and that their role will be to rebuild Arda after the Final Battle.

 Maiar of Aulë 
 Mairon (Sauron), the mightiest of the Maiar of Aulë who used his knowledge of the metaphysical structure of Arda to great effect as a servant of Melkor in the First Age of Middle-earth and then was his own master in the Second and Third Ages. When Sauron sought to corrupt the elves in the Second Age one of the names he assumed was Aulendil, meaning devotee of Aulë.

 Curumo (Saruman), the leader of the wizards sent to lead the people of Middle-earth against Sauron, only to betray his fellow wizards and ally with Sauron himself (who he also betrayed in the end).

It is interesting to note that two of the greatest Maiar sent to Middle-earth, that fell, were in the beginning both aligned with Aulë. The reason for this is probably that this is the order most associated with craft, skill, and by these means, power. Weaker-willed spirits often fall prey to craving for power in Tolkien's works, and these prove no exception. Also, Tolkien generally sees industry as corruption. It seems Maiar of Aulë are the most powerful Maia because they are the closest to Ilúvatar's creation skills.

Powers
Aulë seems to have a power most akin to Ilúvatar's - he can create an innumerable amount of things. He made the Two Lamps, and made Angainor, Morgoth's chain. Although he does not have access to the Flame Imperishable, he was able to create life (although it does not have free will). As a Valar, he possesses incredible strength, and has been noted to have rebuilt Arda during and after Morgoth's period of destruction before the coming of the Elves. He likely forged the Valar's weaponry and armor for the War of Wrath. His strength is in the construction of new things, and he is as near to the antithesis of the destructive Morgoth as one can be.﻿[2]

Aulë means invention in Quenya.[citation needed]","

""I will take the Ring, though I do not know the way.""
—Frodo, at the Council of Elrond, in The Fellowship of the Ring

Frodo Baggins, son of Drogo Baggins, was a Hobbit of the Shire during the Third Age. He was, and still is, Tolkien's most renowned character for his leading role in the Quest of the Ring, in which he bore the One Ring to Mount Doom, where it was destroyed. He was a Ring-bearer, best friend to his gardener, Samwise Gamgee, and one of the three Hobbits who sailed from Middle-earth to the Uttermost West at the end of the Third Age.

 Biography 
 Childhood 
Much of Frodo's youth was spent at Brandy Hall in Buckland, the ancestral home of the Brandybuck family, including his mother (Primula Brandybuck). Frodo was known as something of a rascal, befriending Meriadoc (Merry) Brandybuck and Peregrin (Pippin) Took and causing trouble wherever they went. They would often steal mushrooms from Farmer Maggot's farm Bamfurlong.[1]  
In TA 2980, when Frodo was only 12 years old, his parents drowned in a boating accident on the Brandywine River. An only child, Frodo stayed in Brandy Hall until his 99-year-old ""uncle"" Bilbo adopted him in TA 2989. Bilbo took Frodo to live with him in his home at Bag End and made him his heir.[2]

    Frodo with Bilbo during his 111th birthday  
The two grew very close in the following years; Frodo learned much of the Elvish language during his time with Bilbo, as well as much of the lore of Middle-earth. The two shared the same birthday, September 22 by Shire Reckoning (around September 12–14 of our calendar), and a party of special magnificence was held at the beginning of The Fellowship of the Ring when Frodo came of age of thirty-three and Bilbo hit the peculiar year of 111.
Bilbo gave a memorable Birthday Speech before playing a joke on his fellow hobbits by using the One Ring to disappear, at which Gandalf quickly reacted and used his staff to create a blinding flash where Bilbo had been standing. The hobbits at the Party were left confused and disgruntled, and Bilbo was never again seen in the Shire.
Before departing for his journey to Rivendell, Bilbo had a long conversation with Gandalf, who finally persuaded him to voluntarily surrender the One Ring. Bilbo left it on the fireplace mantel with a note for Frodo, who would now become the next Ring-bearer.

 Coming of Age and Flight from the Shire 
    Gandalf telling Frodo the story about the One Ring  
After the party finished, Frodo returned home and discovered that he was now the master of Bag End and the recipient of Bilbo's magic ring. Gandalf, ever more curious about the ring's origin, power, and purpose (but not yet positive it was the One Ring), advised the young hobbit against the using the ring. For the next seventeen years, Frodo complied with the wizard's request and hid the Ring in a safe place. However, on April 12, 3018, Gandalf returned to Bag End and warned Frodo that the Ring was actually the One Ring, which the evil lord Sauron needed to rule over Middle-earth. Realizing that Sauron would be looking for the Ring, Gandalf advised the Hobbit to secretly follow Bilbo's journey to Rivendell.
After Frodo's discussion with Gandalf, a rumor started that he was running out of money. This rumor, although not begun by Frodo, was encouraged by him. Merry helped Frodo to purchase a small house at Crickhollow. With the exception of his gardener Sam Gamgee, who had agreed to accompany him to Rivendell, Frodo told the other Hobbits of the Shire that he intended to move to Buckland. He sold his home to the Sackville-Baggins, and, on the September 23, 3018, the day after his fiftieth birthday, Frodo left from Bag End, taking with him Sam and Pippin. They left in the early morning for Bree, and just in time, as Sauron's most powerful servants, the nine Nazgûl, had entered the Shire dressed as Black riders searching for a hobbit with the name of Baggins.

 To Bree 
Frodo was unable to find much information about his pursuers from his conversations with the High Elves and Farmer Maggot, but what they were told was less than encouraging. When Frodo arrived at Buckland, where Merry was waiting, he found that Merry and Pippin already knew about Frodo's ""secret"" journey. Frodo was left with no alternative but to bring the two youngsters with him. They cut through the Old Forest and the Barrow-downs in hopes of losing the Black Riders, which did succeed. They met other troubles in those places though, at the hands of Old Man Willow and the Barrow-Wights, but were rescued twice by Tom Bombadil, a mysterious being who dwelled in a glade in the middle of the Old Forest.

 Strider 
    Frodo meeting Strider in The Prancing Pony  
In Bree, the hobbits stayed at The Prancing Pony, an old inn. Frodo went by the name of Mr. Underhill, attempting to raise as little suspicion as possible. When he noticed a mysteriously cloaked Man sitting in the shadows and smoking a long-stemmed pipe, Frodo asked the innkeeper, Barliman Butterbur, who the man was. The innkeeper referred to the man, a Ranger, as Strider.
That night, black riders arrived in Bree and attacked the inn in search of Frodo and the One Ring, but Strider had managed to hide the Hobbits from them in time. Having gained their trust, Strider introduced himself as Aragorn to Frodo and the others, to whom he also revealed the backstory of the black riders, also called Nazgûl or Ringwraiths. With a pony named Bill that the Hobbits had acquired at Bree, Strider led Frodo and his companions into the Wild. Aragorn would be their guide to Rivendell, and he would lead them through the Midgewater Marshes and to the top of Weathertop.

 Weathertop 
    Frodo is stabbed by the Witch-king's Morgul-knife  
On the night of October the sixth, the Hobbits were attacked by five of the nine Ringwraiths at the hill of Weathertop. In the presence of the Nazgûl, Frodo made the mistake of putting on the Ring. He was able to resist their attempt to take him by drawing his sword and invoking the name of one of the Valar, Elbereth Gilthoniel. Unfortunately, the leader of the Nazgûl, the Witch-king of Angmar, stabbed Frodo in the shoulder (he would have stabbed his heart) with a Morgul-knife. If it had caught him in the heart, Frodo would have become like the Nazgûl, only weaker and under their control. The Ringwraiths were driven away by the appearance of Aragorn and his martial skill; also because he had torches, one of their few weaknesses.
Though Aragorn was a skilled healer, he could not heal Frodo's wound. A fragment of the Ringwraith's blade remained in Frodo's flesh, where it continued to move towards his heart. Near death (or worse), Frodo was rescued by Glorfindel, an Elf-lord, who put the injured Hobbit upon his horse Asfaloth. They were found and pursued by the Nazgûl, as Glorfindel rode and bore Frodo swiftly to the Ford of Bruinen, at the entrance to the valley of Rivendell. Once they had crossed the River Bruinen, the Nine Ringwraiths behind them demanded Frodo give up the Ring, but Frodo refused. Subsequently, the Ringwraiths entered the river and were washed away in a flood called up by Elrond.

    The Hobbits reuniting in Rivendell  
Frodo was soon healed in Rivendell by Elrond, who knew the wound would not ultimately leave him, as it was both spiritual and physical. On the 24th of October 3018, Frodo awoke in Rivendell and was reunited with Bilbo, Gandalf, Aragorn, Sam, Merry, and Pippin. Although Elrond had healed his wound, it continued to ail him yearly for as long as he lived in Middle-earth.

 Quest of the Ring 
 Council of Elrond 
    Frodo placing the One Ring before the Council of Elrond  
After his healing, Frodo was summoned to a great Council that Elrond had organized. Representatives of all the Free Peoples of Middle-earth discussed the history of the Rings of Power and decided that the One Ring must be destroyed. As the ring was shown and tempers flared, argument broke out as to who should carry the Ring on this mission, until Frodo bravely volunteered to take the Ring to Mordor and cast it into the fires of Mount Doom. A member of each of the Free Peoples offered to join Frodo in his quest, thus forming the Fellowship of the Ring.
The Fellowship consisted of Frodo, Samwise, Merry, Pippin, Aragorn, Gandalf, Boromir of Gondor, Legolas of the Woodland Realm, and Gimli of the Dwarves. Before leaving Rivendell, Bilbo gave Frodo his dwarf-made coat of mithril mail and his elven blade Sting. The mithril coat had been given to Bilbo by Thorin after the events of The Hobbit, and Sting had been taken by Bilbo from the den of a troll. On December 25, the Fellowship of the Ring departed from Rivendell and headed south.

 Moria 
    The Hobbits of the Fellowship of the Ring prepare to battle against goblins in Moria  
On January 11, 3019, the Fellowship attempted to cross the Misty Mountains (specifically the Pass of Caradhras), but were unable to due to a snowstorm. They instead traveled through the underground city of Moria at the urging of Gimli. 
Some days in into their dangerous trek through Moria, the Fellowship entered the Chamber of Mazarbul, and was attacked by Orcs and a cave-troll. Frodo helped to defeat the troll before he was stabbed by an orc captain, his mithril-shirt saving him from a deadly blow. The Fellowship then ran from there to the Bridge of Khazad-dum, at which Gandalf dueled Durin's Bane and fell. Once outside Moria, while the Fellowship was grieving, Gimli took Frodo and Sam to look upon the Mirrormere, even in their great hurry.

 Lothlórien 
    Frodo meeting with Galadriel  
Deeply grieved by their loss, the Fellowship journeyed to the Elven kingdom of Lothlórien, where they met the Lady Galadriel and Lord Celeborn. Galadriel showed Frodo a vision of the future in her Mirror. Frodo offered her the One Ring, but she resisted the temptation to take it, passing the test that was laid before her, and accepting the diminishing of the power of the elves. Before the Fellowship departed from Lothlórien, Galadriel gave each member a gift. To Frodo, she gave a phial with the light of the star Eärendil captured inside; this gift would prove hugely important later on in the quest. They were also provided with elven way-bread, other supplies, and ships for their voyage down the Anduin River.

 The Breaking of the Fellowship 
    Frodo puts on the One Ring to hide from Boromir  
The Fellowship continued their journey south to Amon Hen. There, Boromir, a Man of Gondor and a member of the Fellowship, attempted to convince Frodo to bring the Ring to Minas Tirith and regroup from there. When the hobbit asked for an hour alone to consider his options, Boromir followed him. Seeing that Frodo did not intend to take the suggested course of action, Boromir tried to take the Ring from him by force.
Frodo put on the Ring and escaped to the Seat of Seeing, where he watched as war brewed across Middle-Earth and the Eye of Sauron searching for him as he traveled.
Taking off the Ring, he decided to take the item to Mordor alone, without telling the other members of the Fellowship. However, he was joined by his friend Samwise Gamgee, who felt it was necessary that he should protect and guide Frodo. Frodo gave in to Sam's protests, and although reluctant to lead anyone else to his fate, was glad to have Sam's company.
The two hobbits continued toward Mordor, dividing the Fellowship. Here, Boromir was killed by uruk-archers while defending Merry and Pippin; the two young hobbits were then captured by Uruk-hai, and were to be taken to Isengard. Instead of following Samwise and Frodo to Mordor, the Three Hunters decided it more important to rescue Merry and Pippin from their captors. The breaking of the Fellowship was now complete.

 Emyn Muil 
    Frodo and Sam journey towards Mordor  
After leaving what remained of the Fellowship at Amon Hen, Frodo and Sam tried to navigate through the winding paths of the Emyn Muil. After getting lost several times, they were found by Gollum, who at first tried to take the One Ring, but was captured by Sam (with Frodo's help) and tied up with the Elven rope. Frodo, now pitying the creature, decided not to slay Gollum, but forced him to swear an oath of servitude to the master of the precious. Gollum then led them out of the maze and into the Dead Marshes.

 The Dead Marshes 
    Frodo during the passage of the Marshes  
The Dead Marshes followed the razor-sharp rocks of Emyn Muil, and were just as disorienting, if not more so. There was thought to be no route through the marshes, as orcs marched for miles around, although Gollum had secretly discovered a path when out on one of his many errands. He led Frodo and Sam on a safe pathway through the marshes, warning them not to follow what seemed like small torches in the water.
Soon after Frodo, Samwise, and Gollum entered the Dead Marshes, the Witch King came on his dragon, looking for the Ring. Gollum had led the two hobbits to a safe place that they could hide in. 

 Ithilien 
    Frodo taken captive by Faramir's rangers  
Gollum led the two Hobbits to the Black Gate of Mordor, as Frodo had desired, but stopped the Hobbits from passing its doors, as the danger was too great. He then explained about a secret way into Mordor, 'Up the stairs and through the tunnel'. The Hobbits once again found themselves being led by Gollum. After venturing into Ithilien, and witnessing a skirmish between a company of warriors from Haradrim (along with Oliphaunts) and rangers from Gondor, they were apprehended by the ranger's captain, Faramir. When the skirmish had ended, Faramir blindfolded the ring-bearer and his companions and led them to Henneth Annûn, the Window on the West. Upon much interrogation, Samwise foolishly misspoke, and gave away that Frodo was indeed carrying the One Ring. Realizing the importance of the quest, Faramir proved his quality, unlike his brother, Boromir, and let the ring-bearer go free. Later, Gollum was captured in the Forbidden Pool and forcibly taken into the hidden lair. Frodo begged for his safety, and he was not killed, although the rift between master and servant had once again begun to open.

 Minas Morgul and Shelob's Lair 
    Frodo prior to being poisoned by Shelob  
Gollum led the hobbits past the lair of the Witch-king of Angmar, Minas Morgul, and up the stairs into 'The Tunnel'. When they arrived at the top though, they were abandoned by Gollum. They cautiously traveled through the tunnel, and managed to get to the end only to find their way barred by Shelob's great web. Whilst attempting to cut through the webbing, Frodo bravely stood up to Shelob and forced her back further into the tunnels giving him and Sam time enough to hack through the threads and escape. Upon escaping the tunnels, Frodo thought himself safe; however, Shelob, through one of her many tunnels, managed to sneak out and jab him with her stinger. As he was being encased in Shelob's webbing, Samwise was able to draw her into single combat wherein he, using Sting and the Phial of Galadriel, was able to mortally wound her and drive her back into her caves. Sam took the Ring from around Frodo's neck upon hearing Orcish voices, and hid behind some nearby rocks. He overheard the orcs speaking of Frodo, and Sam realized that his master was not dead, but merely paralyzed. Frodo was then taken to the tower of Cirith Ungol to await further torture and questioning.

 Cirith Ungol 
Frodo was taken to the utmost top of Cirith Ungol and imprisoned.  He was stripped of all his clothes and all the things he carried. Squabbling over his mithril vest, fighting broke out amongst the two lead orcs and their battalions, killing almost all the orcs and Uruk-hai in the tower. Sam arrived at the gate of Cirith Ungol, only to find his way blocked by the Two Watchers; he eventually overcame them, journeyed to the tower where Frodo was held, and rescued his master. They fled the tower, having to pass the Watchers again (although this time destroying them), and entered Mordor.

 Mordor and Mount Doom 
Frodo and Sam crawled onward through the empty plains of Mordor, as the Orcs had been sent to the Black Gate to stop the Men of the West's army, and, after falling in and out of a company of Orcs, started to climb Mount Doom. They journeyed on for many days with hardly any food or water, and Frodo became progressively weaker as the Ring's power over him grew the closer they came to Orodruin. Frodo was eventually unable to go on, and Sam was forced to carry him a fair distance while his master rested upon his back. It was then that Gollum decided to reappear, and after a brief struggle, Sam cut Gollum in the stomach, and Frodo fled up the mountain.    Frodo missing a finger  
Inside the Crack of Doom, Frodo finally had the chance to destroy the ring, and rid himself of his burden, but the power of the ring was at its strongest, due to the proximity of the cracks. It was here that Frodo finally yielded to the temptation and power of the ring. Sam yelled for Frodo to destroy the Ring, but Frodo was overcome by its power and claimed the Ring for himself. Gollum attacked Sam, who fell and hit his head on a rock, temporarily knocking him unconscious. When he came to he saw Gollum fighting with an unseen foe (Frodo, having put on the Ring). Then Gollum bit off Frodo's finger, Ring and all, and was reunited with his treasure for a short time, until dancing with joy he toppled off the brink and fell into the depths, destroying himself and the One Ring.

    Sam and Frodo after the completion of their quest  The two hobbits tried to escape as the volcano erupted. Just as it looked as though they were doomed, Gwaihir the Lord of Eagles saw them, and with his Eagle companions Landroval and Meneldor rescued Sam and Frodo and flew them to safety.
 End of the War 
 The Scouring of the Shire 
After recovering in Minas Tirith, and witnessing the coronation of King Aragorn, Frodo, Sam, Merry, and Pippin all returned to the Shire. When they arrived though, they found it under the control of a man named Sharkey (later revealed to be Saruman) and his forces. Saruman was ruling the Shire from Bag End, although he was later murdered by Grima Wormtongue. Frodo, Sam, Merry, and Pippin however, started to gather all the Shirriffs and townsfolk in the Shire, and they successfully defeated the Ruffians employed by Sharkey at the Battle of Bywater.
Frodo was not directly involved in the fighting at the Battle of Bywater; instead, he made sure that no Hobbits were harmed (saying that no Hobbit had ever intentionally harmed another in the Shire and that it was not going to begin there), and also that any ruffians that surrendered were not harmed.

 Fourth Age 
    Frodo gazes fondly at his friends as he bids them farewell at the Grey Havens  
Following the scouring of the Shire and end of the War of the Ring in November TA 3019, Frodo served as Deputy Mayor of the Shire until mid-years day of TA 3020, but soon realized that he still bore the wounds of his quest, and so retired, leaving the office back to Will Whitfoot. He was also in continual pain from his shoulder wound, which pained him on each anniversary of their stay at Weathertop. He also on each anniversary of being stung by Shelob would fall ill. In the next two years he tried to a live as peacefully as possible. On May 1st, TA 3020, Frodo attended the wedding of his best friend Sam and his wife Rosie Cotton and they moved in with him at Bag End. He also on October 6th later of that year would be ill from his wounds again. On March 13th, TA 3021 Frodo would be ill from his wounds once more, and he would also continue to briefly live with Sam and Rosie and even witness the birth and meet his oldest daughter Elanor twelve days later. He also, prior to departing Middle-earth, wrote his own story ""The Lord of the Rings"" along with Bilbo's ""There and Back Again"" in the Red Book of Westmarch.
On 29 September SR 1421 (Fourth Age), at the age of 53, Frodo joined Bilbo, Gandalf, Elrond, Galadriel, and Círdan aboard an Elven ship. He was allowed passage across the sea to the Undying Lands, as he was a ring-bearer, with the hope of healing the damage to his spirit that bearing the Ring had caused as much as possible. 
Sometime in or after the year 61 in the Fourth Age, fellow ring-bearer and best friend Samwise Gamgee, reunited with Frodo in the undying lands where it was presumed they lived out the remainder of their days. Its possible that in FO 120 he would reunite with Legolas and Gimli after they sailed for the undying lands. However this is unlikely as Frodo would have passed away by this point.

 Characteristics 
    Frodo, Sam, Merry, and Pippin at the pub  
Frodo, as described by Gandalf, was ""taller than some and fairer than most, (with) a cleft in his chin: perky chap with a bright eye."" (The Fellowship of the Ring, Chapter 10, ""Strider"") He was a shy, young hobbit with thick, curly brown hair like most other hobbits, and had lighter-than-usual skin due to his Fallohide ancestry through his Brandybuck mother. He could be described as fairly good looking for a hobbit. Frodo is described as appearing thirty-three, even when he is fifty, due to the influence of the Ring.
Bilbo and Frodo shared a common birthday on September 22, but Bilbo was 78 years Frodo's senior. At the opening of The Fellowship of the Ring, Frodo and Bilbo were celebrating their thirty-third and eleventy-first (111th) birthdays, respectively.
Frodo, like Bilbo, was considered by many others in Hobbiton to be a little odd. His curiosity of the outside world, fascination with Elves and faraway places (like those to which Bilbo traveled in The Hobbit) did not fit the general content personality of most Hobbits. This curiosity was also attributed to his Took ancestry. He was very kind and compassionate, pitying Gollum and allowing him to guide him and Sam to Mordor despite Sam's distrust of the creature. This act of kindness later proved to be a factor in the quest's success in destroying the Ring.
The influence of the Ring and the wound by the Morgul-Blade seems combined to have given him the ability to see into the spirit world, for instance he sees faraway events in his dreams on several occasions. He also can see the ring of power worn by Galadriel and he seems to be able to sense danger.

 Attire 
Frodo was dressed in typical Hobbit-fashion when he left the Shire: knee breeches, shirt, waistcoat, jacket, and cloak. Colors such as bright green and yellow were typical for Shire-folk. He was unarmed, save for a pocketknife.
When his little group was waylaid by Barrow-wights, he lost his summer-weight clothing and was wearing a burial shrift when rescued by Tom Bombadil. When their pack-ponies returned, he was forced to put on heavier woollen clothing intended for colder weather. The Hobbits found several long Dúnedain daggers in the wight's treasure. These served as short-swords for the Hobbits, but Frodo's was broken when he resisted the Witch-king at Weathertop. At Imladris, he removed his Hobbit clothing upon finding new Elven clothes that fitted him perfectly. Therefore, throughout his quest, he wore a green silk tunic, trousers together with cloaks made of fur for the first stages of the quest, and then towards Mordor he shed them to wear his tunic and trousers in the warmer weather. Later, his Uncle Bilbo gave him both Sting, a magic Elven dagger, and a coat of mithril chain mail. The mail saved his life twice, first when it deflected a spear-point in the Mines of Moria, and second when it turned aside the dagger that Saruman used to try and kill him.
As with the other members of the Fellowship of the Ring, Frodo received a special cloak from Galadriel in Lórien, which allowed him to blend in with natural surroundings. Upon being betrayed by Gollum and captured by Orcs at Cirith Ungol, Frodo lost all of his clothing and most of his possessions. Sam Gamgee saved Sting, however. After the two tribes of orcs had slain each other in the tower of Cirith Ungol, Frodo dressed himself in Orc-garb. This successfully fooled the Mordor-Orcs they encountered, but he dropped the Orc mail and helmet as he and Sam approached Mount Doom.

In the movies, Frodo seems to have owned the Ring for only a few days or perhaps a few months before Gandalf returned, as opposed to the seventeen years of the book. Frodo never sells Bag End, but sets out early next morning with Sam. Merry and Pippin run into the pair at the farm of Farmer Maggot and are pulled into the journey. The Hobbits are pursued by the Black Riders all the way to Bucklebury Ferry on the borders of Buckland. There the Black Riders are forced to ride to the Brandywine Bridge while the Hobbits make for Bree. The movies remove several parts of the journey as well. These include their encounters with the High Elves, Farmer Maggot, and Tom Bombadil, as well as their visit to Buckland, the Old Forest, and the Barrow-downs.
Arwen, Elrond's daughter, leads Frodo to Rivendell instead of Glorfindel. The Cave-troll inflicts the wound on Frodo in Moria, instead of the orc captain. In the novel, Faramir declared right from the first that he wanted no part of the One Ring, but in the film Faramir at first follows what he believes is his duty to bring the Ring back to Minas Tirith. But while travelling with Frodo, Sam, and Gollum through the city of Osgiliath, the city is attacked by a Nazgûl and the forces of Mordor, and Faramir realizes he should not take the Ring after he sees the effect it has on Frodo.

""If more of us valued food and cheer and song above hoarded gold, it would be a merrier world.""
—Thorin, to (and about) Bilbo

Bilbo Baggins was a hobbit of the Shire, the main protagonist of The Hobbit and a secondary character in The Lord of the Rings. 
Gandalf suggested to Thorin and Company that they hire Bilbo Baggins to be their burglar in the Quest of Erebor, and later fought in the Battle of Five Armies. Bilbo was also one of the bearers of the One Ring, and the first to voluntarily give it up, although with some difficulty. He wrote many of his adventures in a book he called There and Back Again. Bilbo adopted his second-cousin-once-removed Frodo Baggins to be his heir after his parents, Drogo Baggins and Primula Brandybuck, drowned in the Brandywine River.
Bilbo was the first hobbit to become famous in the world at large, and one of the few to set foot in the Undying Lands.

 Biography 
 Early life 
Bilbo Baggins was born on September 22 by Shire Reckoning (around September 12-14 of our calendar), in the year 2890 of the Third Age. He was the only son of Bungo Baggins and Belladonna Took.
In Hobbiton, Bungo Baggins constructed a spacious and luxurious Hobbit-hole for Belladonna, which they named Bag End. The family moved to their new home, where Bilbo would spend much of his life.

    A young Bilbo upon first meeting Gandalf  
As a young Hobbit, Bilbo was curious and eager for news of the outside world. The Istar wizard, Gandalf, took interest in this unusual quality in Bilbo during his visits to the Shire. Bilbo would later remember Gandalf's Firework displays in the dwelling of his mother's family at Great Smials. Bilbo apparently practiced his rock-throwing skills in his youth so much, that birds and squirrels fled the area whenever he bent down to pick up a rock.
When Bilbo's father and mother died in TA 2926 and TA 2934 respectively, Bilbo became his own master and spent the next seven years living alone in Bag End. During this time, Bilbo grew fond of his life as a wealthy bachelor and acquired a reputation for respectability that the neighbors admired.

 Quest of Erebor 
Main article: Quest of Erebor

 An Unexpected Journey 
    Gandalf invites Bilbo on an ""adventure""  
In the year TA 2941, Bilbo, at the age of 50, was visited by Gandalf, whom he had not seen for quite some time, outside his home at Bag End. Gandalf invited Bilbo on an unspecified adventure, which was flatly refused by the hobbit, who bade the wizard a ""Good morning"", and went inside.
Undeterred, Gandalf continued in his plan, sending thirteen dwarves, led by Thorin Oakenshield, to Bag End the very day. These dwarves, needing an additionally member for their company, initially came by pairs, and lastly with Gandalf, who had himself selected Bilbo as the best person for the dwarves' job. The dwarves explained to Bilbo their background and purpose; that they were among the Dwarves of Erebor who had been forced from the Lonely Mountain when the dragon Smaug attacked and taken up residence there. They now had determined to reclaim the mountain and needed a ""burglar"" to help them in situations requiring stealth. Bilbo reluctantly agreed to go, and the next morning they set off from The Green Dragon Inn.[1]

    Thorin's Company traverses the Lone-lands  
Thorin and company traveled through the Lone-lands along high hills and beside castles. After approximately one month since their outset, Gandalf disappeared. Óin and Glóin failed to make a fire during a rainy night, and Balin spotted a fire in the distance, which was rare in those regions, and sent Bilbo to investigate. At the fire were three Stone-trolls, Tom, Bert, and William. Bilbo attempted to snatch something from the trolls to bring back to the Dwarves, to show that he was a first-class burglar. However, he was caught by William, but he escaped and was helpless to prevent all the dwarves from being captured when they came looking for him. Fortunately for the dwarves, Gandalf returned and saved them all by imitating the trolls' voices and tricking the trolls into arguing with one another until daybreak, which turned them all to stone. After rescuing the party, the wizard led Bilbo and the party to the trolls' cave, which the trolls had used to hide their treasure and shield themselves from the sun during the daylight hours. In the cave, a number of weapons were found, Glamdring (Beater) and Orcrist (Biter) among them. Bilbo took an Elvish dagger from the trolls' collection, no longer than a small knife in size, which he would later name Sting. He kept it with him for the rest of his adventure, wearing it inside his breeches.[2]
In June the company came to Rivendell. During their visit, Bilbo met Lord Elrond, and became enchanted with the Elves. On midsummer eve Elrond inspected the swords of Thorin and Gandalf and looked at Thrór's Map, which Gandalf had previously given to Thorin at the behest of Thorin's father Thrain. Elrond explained that the swords were forged in Gondolin and were named Orcrist and Glamdring. When inspecting the map Elrond found Moon letters that spoke of the side-door of Erebor, which read: Stand by the grey stone when the thrush knocks and the setting sun with the last light of Durin's Day will shine upon the keyhole.[3]

 Discovery of the One Ring 
Bilbo and his companions then traveled from Rivendell and made their way to the High Pass of the Misty Mountains, where they witnessed the distant thunder-battle of giants. It was here the company, after taking shelter in what they took to be a simple cave, were captured by goblins and taken to Goblin-town. With Gandalf's help, they escaped from the Great Goblin and his servants. Dori, however, who was carrying Bilbo, was grabbed from behind by a goblin, and in the ensuing struggle Bilbo lost consciousness and was inadvertently left by his companions.[4]

    Bilbo finds The One Ring  Coming to and finding himself alone, Bilbo crawled his way through the pitch-black tunnel, using his hobbit nose to gain a sense of direction. He eventually stumbled upon a small ring, but thought nothing of it, and put it in his back pocket. Although he did not know it, this lost trinket was the One Ring, forged by the Dark Lord Sauron thousands of years ago. Bilbo soon encountered Gollum, who had been in possession of the Ring for over five hundred years. The two challenged each other to a game of riddles with the condition that Gollum would show the way out if Bilbo won. However, Gollum was not satisfied with Bilbo's final riddle, and while mourning his loss, found that his Ring was gone. Gollum then realized the answer to Bilbo's riddle, ""What have I got in my pocket?"" and paddled back on his boat towards Bilbo, who he then accused of stealing his precious, but Bilbo had vanished.[5]
Gollum, thinking Bilbo had known the way out and was leaving, headed to the exit and was followed by Bilbo. Bilbo was soon reunited with his companions. Bilbo and the travelers had stopped for the night when goblins and a pack of wargs found them near a patch of pine trees. The dwarves, Bilbo, and Gandalf climbed up the trees to escape, but the goblins were not going to leave without killing them. They started to burn the trees down. The warg chieftain was ordering the other wargs around when Gandalf picked up a pinecone, and with his magic set it ablaze in a green fire. He threw it down hitting the chieftain. It rolled around on the ground burning while Gandalf threw more and more pinecones down. The goblins and wargs fled and the group was rescued by eagles. When an eagle grabbed Dori, Bilbo had to jump and grab Dori's legs before he was forgotten. This prompted Bilbo to groan ""My arms! My poor arms,"" and Dori to cry, ""My legs! My poor legs!"" The eagles eventually took them to their eyrie where they rested and continued their journey.[6]

 Into Wilderland 
    Bilbo and Gandalf with Beorn  
The group traveled to Beorn's house where they rested, after being gruffly taken in by Beorn and his animal servants. Beorn learned their story and gave a large number of provisions to help their quest. Beorn also lent several ponies to be used until the group reached Mirkwood. However, Beorn did not fully trust the dwarves, so Bilbo saw Beorn giving careful watch to see that his ponies were unharmed. Eventually the company reached Mirkwood, where the ponies were let go (to several of the dwarves discontent) and Gandalf left the group as well, warning them, ""Do not stray off the path.""[7]

    Bilbo reaches the canopy of Mirkwood  
The Company began to follow the path through the treacherous forest. Eventually the provisions ran low and the Company was forced to send Bilbo up a tree to see where the forest ended. Bilbo climbed up a tree, where a rewarding breeze of cool air and butterflies met him. Bilbo only saw more forest, so when he reluctantly climbed back down, he did not see that the forest ended. He reported his findings to the dwarves, where they met the news with ill comfort, angry that the dwarves were fatter than Bilbo and so could not climb the trees to feel cool air or see the butterflies. Eventually the last provisions were eaten. The Company then came upon the Enchanted stream, of which they had been warned not to drink by Beorn. Bilbo saw a boat on the other side, leading the dwarves to retrieve it. A deer came out of nowhere when all the dwarves were on the other side. A dwarf shot it where it died, on the other side. The dwarves hoped for venison for dinner when Bilbo realized that Bombur was drowning. The dwarves fished him out to find he had been put to sleep by the stream's magic, but the boat was knocked away, ending the hope for venison.
While wandering down the path, the dwarves saw lights in the forest. Deciding that they would rather leave the path than starve to death they headed after the lights. As soon as they got to the lights, they went out and one of their party fell asleep. This happened twice. On the third time all of them fell asleep.

    Bilbo faces the spiders of Mirkwood  
When Bilbo awoke in the night, he was alone. He cursed the dwarves for leaving the path and discovered that great spiders had captured his companions. Bilbo was forced to find his lost companions and cut through the cocoons the spiders had formed around his companions. He distracted the spiders by improvising several insulting songs to irritate them, and succeeded when the creatures left their domain to find the intruder and eat him. Bilbo killed a few by throwing stones at them and by stabbing them with Sting. The spiders never found him, since during this time Bilbo made use of the Ring to remain invisible. After freeing the dwarves, he led them into a charge against the spiders, where the company killed dozens of the arachnids.[8]
After traveling through Mirkwood the dwarves were taken prisoner by Wood-elves, who believed that the company had ""assaulted"" the elves while they were partying (the bright lights the company had seen in the forest). Bilbo avoided being caught by using the ring to stay invisible, and followed them into the halls of Thranduil, the elven-king, where they were held captive. Eventually Bilbo was able to rescue the dwarves by stealing the butler Galion's keys, and found a way for the company to escape the Woodland Realm by stowing away in a number of empty barrels, which periodically were taken by the elves up the River Running to Lake-town for trading purposes. The plan worked, and soon they all arrived at Lake-town, which they found to be a small town occupied by men that Smaug would frequently attack, though he had not been seen in many years.[9]
The men of Lake-town took Bilbo and the dwarves to the great hall to present the company to the Master and his councilors, and though the Master initially thought to imprison them in order to keep good relations with the wood-elves, he decided against it when the populace proved to be strongly in support of Thorin's company. Thus, Bilbo and the dwarves spent several weeks in Lake-town as guests of honor, though Bilbo eventually caught cold.[10]

 The Lonely Mountain 
Before long Thorin's company departed Lake-town, and crossing the river, followed Thrór's Map to the location of the side-door before the end of Durin's Day. Upon discovering the keyhole, the door was opened and Bilbo was sent in alone in order to scout ahead and perhaps to steal some treasure from Smaug.[11] When he arrived in the treasure chamber, however, Smaug was awake and sensed his presence, and so Bilbo put on the ring to avoid being seen.    Bilbo conversing with Smaug  
Smaug, though unable to see the hobbit, tried to figure out who or what the intruder was, but Bilbo refused to tell the dragon his true identity, answering Smaug's questions only in riddles. While invisible, Bilbo noticed that Smaug had a bare spot on his jewel-encrusted underbelly. Finally, Bilbo removed the ring and Smaug saw that he had stolen a cup, causing him to go into a terrible rage. After Bilbo made it out of Smaug's lair safely, he convinced Thorin and the other dwarves to enter the side-door and close it behind them, which saved their lives when Smaug left the mountain, and flying to the side-door, scorched the surrounding area. Foiled, the dragon flew off to Lake-town with the intent to destroy it once and for all.[12] Bilbo afterwards relayed to the dwarves what he had learned, but a thrush, hearing the information, flew to Lake-town and told Bard, a descendant of the Men of Dale, of Smaug's weakness. On Smaug's arrival, Bard shot the Black Arrow at the bare spot, killing Smaug and sending him to rot at the bottom of the lake, but destroying part of Lake-town.[13]

 The Battle of Five Armies and aftermath 
""There is more in you of good than you know, child of the kindly West. Some courage and some wisdom, blended in measure. If more of us valued food and cheer and a song above hoarded gold, it would be a merrier world.""
—The Hobbit, ""The Return Journey""

    Bilbo gives the Arkenstone to Thranduil  
In the meantime, Thorin and company had reclaimed the Lonely Mountain, though Bilbo, having found the Arkenstone that Thorin greatly desired, kept it secret from the dwarf.[14] They were informed by Roäc, an old raven of the mountain, of Smaug's death in Lake-town, but quickly the dwarves' mirth was dampened by the news that the surviving Men of Lake-town and the Elven-king's army were marching to the mountain to reclaim their wealth. Thorin, suspicious of the armies, refused to make any deal, with them at their arrival, and barricaded the mountain, thus beginning a siege.[15] Bilbo, hoping to avoid conflict, took the Arkenstone to Bard and Thranduil, in order for them to barter their share of the treasure with. Despite Bard and the Elvenking's offers for the hobbit to stay with them for the time being, Bilbo decided to return to the mountain. To his surprise on leaving to return to Thorin's company, he found that Gandalf had returned, and found the wizard supported his decision. Bilbo then slipped back to the mountain unnoticed by the dwarves.[16]

    Bilbo admits to taking the Arkenstone  
Thorin, on soon afterwards discovering Bilbo's perceived treachery, was furious and banished the hobbit from the mountain. Bilbo stayed with Gandalf and Bard for a short time, until dwarves from the Iron Hills, led by Dain Ironfoot, arrived to aid Thorin's cause. However, shortly following this, a great army of goblins, led by Bolg, attacked, forcing the dwarves, elves, and men to fight together to both defend the mountain and survive. This became known as the Battle of Five Armies, and though the goblins were defeated, Thorin and his nephews Fili and Kili were mortally wounded. Bilbo only witnessed part of the battle, as he was rendered unconscious early on, and wearing the ring, lay undiscovered until he came to following the battle's conclusion.[17] Beorn, the Beorning chieftain, who had joined the fight, slew Bolg along with his bodyguard and carried Thorin to safety. Bilbo, making his way to the tents of the wounded, found Thorin lying on a bed, in his last minutes of life. Thorin praised Bilbo and apologized to him for cursing him earlier, and thereafter passed away.

    Bilbo leaves Gandalf to return to Hobbiton  
After Thorin's funeral, Dain offered him his one-fourteenth share of the treasure, but Bilbo declined, receiving only two small chests, one with gold, and the other laden with silver. Bilbo traveled back with the wood-elf host that participated in the Battle of Five Armies. Bilbo traveled with the wood-elves down to Mirkwood, and then went to Beorn's house with Gandalf.[18] Then Bilbo set out with Gandalf to where Bert, Tom, and William had turned to stone. They dug up some of the buried treasure the dwarves had buried earlier, most of which Bilbo offered to Gandalf to use to aid the peoples of Middle-earth. When they at last came to the borders of the Shire, the two parted, with Gandalf going his own way.

 Return to the Shire 
    Bilbo finds his belongings being auctioned off.   Bilbo eventually made it back to Hobbiton, where he found an auction taking place at which his relatives, the Sackville-Bagginses, believing him dead, were selling most of his possessions to the other hobbits. The Sackville-Bagginses were vexed to see Bilbo alive, since they wanted to live in Bag End themselves. Bilbo had to buy back his sold possessions in order to avoid quarreling with them. Eventually, Balin and Gandalf visited him, where they reported the current news of Middle-earth.[19]
 Later years 
 Returning to Shire-life 
Although Bilbo returned safely to Bag End with his reward and lived in relative comfort, Bilbo’s life was not quite the same as it had once been. His sudden return after having been thought dead lost him some of the neighbors’ respect and he was later thought of as an oddity, and there were many talks and false rumors circulated about his affairs and doings. The worst of these problems came from the Sackville-Bagginses, who were angry that they were not able to possess Bag End when he was thought to be dead. This jealousy and anger increased when Bilbo adopted his second-cousin-once-removed Frodo (a Brandybuck) as his heir apparent.
Bilbo ignored these things said about him and avoided the Sackville-Bagginses as much as he could, even using the Ring once to hide from them. Bilbo was very generous with his money and most people were willing to forgive him for his oddities. He had many friends especially amongst the Gamgees whom he consulted frequently on landscaping and on the growing of vegetables. His good friend The Gaffer even allowed him to tutor his son Samwise Gamgee. Bilbo taught him to read and write, and at some point taught him various bits of poetry and told him tales of the elder days. Yet, he slowly began to become weary of his settled and sheltered life at Bag End.

 Another adventure 
    Bilbo at the time of his 111th birthday party  
Bilbo was the bearer of the One Ring for six decades, ignorant of its significance. However, by TA 3001, the Ring had begun to affect him. He did not appear to have aged at all, although he felt older and thin inside. He decided that he wanted to partake in one more adventure before he found a place to settle down and finish his account of the Quest for the Lonely Mountain.
On September 22, a farewell Birthday Party was held in his honor, where he announced his intention to leave the Shire, to the shock of his family and friends. Immediately afterward, he put on his ring and disappeared, as a joke on his neighbors. He returned to his house where he was confronted by his friend Gandalf, who tried to persuade him to leave the Ring for Frodo. Bilbo initially agreed, but then became hostile and accused Gandalf of trying to steal the ring for his own benefit, which he referred to as his ""precious.""


""Well, if you want my ring yourself, say so! But you won't get it. I won't give my Precious away, I tell you.""
—Bilbo Baggins[20]

    Bilbo gives up the Ring before leaving Bag End  
Horrified by Bilbo's outburst, Gandalf stood to his full height and ordered Bilbo to leave it behind. Immediately Bilbo returned to his senses, apologizing and admitting that the Ring had been troubling him lately. After a moment of inner struggle, Bilbo finally dropped the ring to the ground, becoming the first ring-bearer to give up the ring on his own will. Bilbo and Gandalf bade each other goodbye, and Bilbo left the Shire for his journey.
On the same day, Bilbo left the One Ring and his home of Bag End in the possession of his relative, Frodo Baggins, who was eager to be his own master despite the loss of Bilbo, for he was not yet ready to leave the Shire. After his departure, Bilbo wandered to Rivendell and then, after a rest, accompanied some dwarves to Dale, before returning to Rivendell.

 Life in Rivendell 
    Bilbo Baggins at Rivendell  
Between TA 3003 and TA 3018, Bilbo worked on the written account of his adventures, in a book that would later be known as the Red Book of Westmarch. He also studied the Elvish language and compiled a three-volume history of the Elder Days, which he called Translations from the Elvish. He composed the poem All that is Gold Does Not Glitter for Aragorn as well as a much longer poem about Eärendil during his stay at Rivendell.[21]
In October 3018, Frodo arrived at Rivendell. Bilbo learned that his nephew was on a quest to destroy the One Ring so he gave him the sword Sting and for protection his mithril shirt. However, he remained in Rivendell while Frodo traveled south. After Frodo returned, Bilbo had noticeably aged, partially freed from the Ring's effect, although he continued to desire it.

 Leaving Middle-earth 
Since Bilbo had been a ring-bearer, he was allowed to accompany Frodo away to the Undying Lands. On September 22, 3021, Bilbo turned 131 and became the oldest hobbit in Middle-earth (unless Sméagol is counted to have remained a hobbit). On September 29, he, Gandalf, Elrond, Galadriel, and Frodo boarded a ship docked at the Grey Havens and sailed away from Middle-earth. His fate afterward is not known but as he too was a mortal being, he most likely died in the light of the Blessed Realm of Valinor.[22]

 Character 
Bilbo was a very friendly and well-mannered hobbit fond of food, drink, a full pipe, his friends and good cheer, and was known for greeting strangers and friends with hospitality saying; ""At your service and your family's."" Being related to both the Tooks and the Baggins, two kins of fundamentally opposite mentalities, with the Tooks being more fond of adventures and wandering, and the Baggins not at all, Bilbo at times recognized two sides within himself, his ""Took side"" and ""Baggins side"". He secretly relished having adventures, but still wanted to remain settled and would afraid in face of a real prospect of adventure.Bilbo seemed to be happy with his life at Bag End, and would have been content to remain a child of his father, had adventure not come upon him. Still very afraid and wishing he had never left his hobbit-hole, the Took side eventually won out, even after he returned home to his old life. Thus, his desire for another adventure never truly departed from him in his heart even into his old age. This he demonstrated in his sudden departure from Bag End in TA 3001.

 Video games 
    Bilbo Baggins from The Hobbit 2003 game  
Bilbo Baggins appears in the game The Hobbit (2003), as the only playable character. His weapons include Sting, a walking/fighting stick, and collectible rocks. Bilbo's stick can be quite powerful against enemies that cannot block - it is most effective against agile spiders that inflict significant damage yet do not have much health of their own. It can also be used to pole-vault across wide expanses. Throughout the game, Bilbo collects scrolls that give him new or improved attacks.

 Other 
The 2005 documentary Ringers: Lord of the Fans features a delivery of ""The Ballad of Bilbo Baggins"", a song performed by Star Trek actor Leonard Nimoy in 1967.

""Manwë summoned the Valar for a council at which it was resolved to send out three emissaries to Middle-earth and he asked who would go... Only two came forward; Curumo and Alatar... and Alatar took Pallando as a friend.""
—Prior to the arrival of the Istari in the West

Alatar (Quenya; IPA: [ˈalatar] - ""After-Comer""), also called Morinehtar (Quenya; [moriˈneçtar]) was a Maia and an immortal Istar wizard. He travelled to Middle-earth in the Second Age with Rómestámo (Pallando), and they became the Ithryn Luin, or ""Blue Wizards"".
They travelled to the east of Arda, to countries in far eastern Middle-earth such as Rhûn and Khand, where they were sent to stir up rebellions against those serving Sauron. In this, they were successful, and they later returned to Middle-earth in the Third Age and travelled East and South once again, but they never returned to the West after their journey with Saruman. It is possible that they became the founders of secret and magical cults, but their ultimate fate remains unknown.

 Biography 
 Second Age 
""Their task was to circumvent Sauron: to bring help to the few tribes of Men that had rebelled from Melkor-worship, to stir up rebellion... and after his first fall to search out his hiding and to cause dissension and disarray among the dark East... They must have had very great influence on the history of the Second Age and Third Age in weakening and disarraying the forces of the East... who both in the Second Age and Third Age otherwise have... outnumbered the West.""
—J.R.R. Tolkien

    Alatar  
Alatar was originally a Maia of Oromë the Huntsman named Morinehtar, and presumably lived in his forests on the continent of Aman, west of Middle-earth. The other servants of Oromë included Rómestámo (later Pallando), who was a friend of Morinehtar's, and whom he later chose to journey with him. At some point in the Second Age, around the forging of the Rings of Power, Mohrinehtar and Rómestámo were chosen to become the first of the Istari, and were sent to the East of Middle-earth to stir up rebellion against Sauron and assist the few tribes of Men who had refused to worship Morgoth in the First Age.[1]


 Third Age 
""I think that they went as emissaries to distant regions, east and south, .... Missionaries to enemy occupied lands as it were. What success they had I do not know; but I fear that they failed, as Saruman did, though doubtless in different ways; and I suspect they were founders or beginners of secret cults and ""magic"" traditions that outlasted the fall of Sauron.""
—J.R.R. Tolkien

During the Third Age, the Valar selected Morinehtar, renamed Alatar, meaning ""after-comer"", and Pallando to be two of the five Maiar to travel from the Undying Lands to Middle-earth and serve as Istari wizards. Alatar, Curumo (Saruman the White) and Olórin (Gandalf the Grey) were assigned the objective of encouraging the peoples of Middle-earth to oppose Sauron. However, two more joined the original three Wizards and they became five. Aiwendil (Radagast the Brown) was chosen by Yavanna to travel with Curumo, and Alatar took Pallando the Blue as a companion. Upon arrival in Middle-earth, Alatar and Pallando were dressed in robes of sea-blue. Due to this, they were called the Blue Wizards (or Ithryn Luin, in Sindarin). With Saruman, they travelled east in an attempt to help free the last Men of Númenor, who were now Haradrim and Easterlings. Later, Saruman came back to the west alone. However, Alatar and Pallando were never seen again, and their ultimate fates are unknown.[2][3]

 Character 
When Alatar came to Middle-earth, he was clothed in flesh and had the appearance of a wizened old man, though he did not look as old as Gandalf. He and Pallando were dressed in robes of sea-blue, which was why they were named ""the Blue Wizards"".[1] He had a white beard which was not as long as Gandalf's or Saruman's. He carried a staff, as did the other Wizards, which he could use to channel his magic.

 Etymology 
Alatar probably means ""after-comer"" (as he was one of the original two Maiar to be chosen to become Wizards and follow Sauron to Middle earth). J.R.R. Tolkien specifically stated that neither Alatar nor Pallando had a name in the West of Middle-earth, unlike the other three Wizards, who all had two names. Therefore, Tolkien probably intended ""Alatar"" to be more of a title or a description than a name. Later in his life, Tolkien wrote a note, suggesting that the names of the Blue Wizards were Morinehtar and Rómestámo. It is not clear whether these names were intended to replace the names Alatar and Pallando, or whether Morinehtar and Rómestámo were alternate names for the Blue Wizards, possibly those given to them by the peoples of Middle-earth.[4]

 Portrayal in adaptations 
 The Hobbit trilogy 
When talking to Bilbo, Gandalf the Grey mentions the two Blue Wizards in The Hobbit: An Unexpected Journey. When Bilbo asks how many Wizards there are, Gandalf states that there is him, Saruman, the two Blue Wizards (whose names he cannot remember), and Radagast the Brown. They are never mentioned in the Lord of the Rings films, only referenced by Saruman who mentions ""the rods of the five wizards"" in the extended edition of the third film.

","Baldor also known as Baldor the Hapless, was the oldest son of Brego, 2nd Lord of the Mark, and brother of Aldor, 3rd Lord of the Mark.
He was said to have passed along the Paths of the Dead, through the Dark Door under Dwimorberg. Theoden said ""A rash vow he spoke, as he drained the horn at the feast which Brego made to hallow new-built Meduseld, and he never came to the high seat of which he was the heir"".
After passing through the Dark Door, Aragorn found ""...the bones of a mighty man. He had been clad in mail, and still his harness lay there whole; for the cavern's air was as dry as dust, and his hauberk was gilded. His belt was of gold and garnets, and rich with gold was the helm upon his bony head face downward on the floor. He had fallen near the far wall of the cave, as now could be seen, and before him stood a stony door closed fast: his finger-bones were still clawing at the cracks. A notched and broken sword lay by him, as if he had hewn at the rock in his last despair. Aragorn did not touch him, but after gazing silently for a while he rose and sighed. 'Hither shall the flowers of simbelmynë come never unto world's end,' he murmured. 'Nine mounds and seven there are now green with grass, and through all the long years he has lain at the door that he could not unlock. Whither does it lead? Why would he pass? None shall ever know!'"" This was, presumably, Baldor.
In an unfinished essay, Tolkien expanded upon Baldor's fate, stating that he made it as far as the door (which led to an old temple built by men who worshipped Sauron) before unknown enemies broke his legs, leaving him to die in the darkness.[1]

Among many academic positions, he was professor of Anglo-Saxon language at the University of Oxford from 1925 to 1945, and of English studies (English language and literature), also at Oxford, from 1945 to 1959. He was a strongly committed Roman Catholic. Tolkien was a close friend of C.S. Lewis, with whom he shared membership in the literary discussion group The Inklings.
In addition to The Hobbit and The Lord of the Rings, Tolkien's published fiction includes The Silmarillion and other posthumously published books about what he called a legendarium, a fictional mythology of the remote past of Earth, called Arda, and Middle-earth (from middangeard, the lands inhabitable by Men) in particular. Most of these works were compiled from Tolkien's notes by his son Christopher Tolkien. The enduring popularity and influence of Tolkien's works have established him as the ""father of the modern high fantasy genre"". Tolkien's other published fiction includes stories for children, not connected to his legendarium.

The significance of his literary oeuvre has generated decades of ""Tolkien scholarship"" and research across the Western world, and a considerable resulting output of secondary literature by many scholars and enthusiasts.    Tolkien and his wife Edith in Bournemouth

 The Tolkien family 
As far as is known, most of Tolkien's paternal ancestors were craftsmen. The Tolkien family had its roots in Saxony (Germany) but had been living in England since the eighteenth century, becoming ""quickly and intensely English (not British)"".[1] The surname Tolkien is anglicized from Tollkiehn (i.e. German tollkühn, ""foolhardy"", literally ""insane(ly)-brave"", the etymological English translation would be dull-keen, a literal translation of oxymoron). The surname Rashbold of two characters in The Notion Club Papers is a pun on this.[2]

 Biography 
 Childhood 
Tolkien was born on January 3, 1892, in Bloemfontein in the Orange Free State 
(now South Africa) to Arthur Tolkien, an English bank manager, and his wife Mabel, née Suffield (1870–1904). Tolkien had one sibling, his younger brother, Hilary Arthur Reuel, who was born on February 17, 1894.[3]
While living in Africa, he was bitten by a large tarantula in the garden, an event which would have later parallels in his stories.[4] When he was three, Tolkien went to England with his mother and brother on what was intended to be a lengthy family visit. His father, however, died in South Africa of rheumatic fever before he could join them.[5] This left the family without an income, so Tolkien's mother took him to live with her parents in Birmingham, England. Soon after in 1896, they moved to Sarehole (now in Hall Green), then a Worcestershire village, later annexed to Birmingham.[6] He enjoyed exploring Sarehole Mill, Moseley Bog, the Clent Hills, and Lickey Hills, which would later inspire scenes in his books along with other Worcestershire towns and villages such as Bromsgrove, Alcester and Alvechurch and places such as his aunt's farm of Bag End, the name of which would be used in his fiction.[7]

    Ronald and Hilary Tolkien in 1905 (from Carpenter's Biography)  
Mabel tutored her two sons, and Ronald, as he was known in the family, was a keen pupil.[8] She taught him a great deal of botany, and she awoke in her son the enjoyment of the look and feel of plants. Young Tolkien liked to draw landscapes and trees. But his favourite lessons were those concerning languages, and his mother taught him the rudiments of Latin very early.[9] He could read by the age of four and could write fluently soon afterward. He attended King Edward's School, Birmingham, and, while a student there, helped ""line the route"" for the coronation parade of King George V, being posted just outside the gates of Buckingham Palace.[10] He later attended St. Philip's School and Exter College, Oxford.
His mother converted to Roman Catholicism in 1900 despite vehement protests by her Baptist family.[11] She died of diabetes in 1904, when Tolkien was twelve, at Fern Cottage, Rednal, which they were then renting. For the rest of his life, Tolkien felt that she had become a martyr for her faith; this had a profound effect on his own Catholic beliefs.[12] Tolkien's devout faith was significant in the conversion of C.S. Lewis to Christianity, though Tolkien was greatly disappointed that Lewis chose to follow Anglicanism.[13]
During his subsequent orphanhood, he was brought up by Father Francis Xavier Morgan of the Birmingham Oratory in the Edgbaston area of Birmingham. He lived there in the shadow of Perrot's Folly and the Victorian tower of Edgbaston waterworks, which may have influenced the images of the dark towers within his works. Another strong influence was the romantic medievalist paintings of Edward Burne-Jones and the Pre-Raphaelite Brotherhood; the Birmingham Museum and Art Gallery has a large and world-renowned collection of works and had put it on free public display from around 1908.

    J.R.R. Tolkien in 1911 (from Carpenter's Biography)  
 Youth 
Tolkien met and fell in love with Edith Mary Bratt, three years his senior, at the age of sixteen. Father Francis forbade him from meeting, talking, or even corresponding with her until he was twenty-one. He obeyed this prohibition to the letter.[14]
In 1911 at age 19, while they were at King Edward's School, Birmingham, Tolkien, and three friends, Rob Gilson, Geoffrey Smith, and Christopher Wiseman, formed a semi-secret society which they called ""the T.C.B.S."", the initials standing for ""Tea Club and Barrovian Society"", alluding to their fondness of drinking tea in Barrow's Stores near the school and, illicitly, in the school library.[15] After leaving school, the members stayed in touch, and in December 1914, they held a ""Council"" in London, at Wiseman's home. For Tolkien, the result of this meeting was a strong dedication to writing poetry.
In the summer of 1911, Tolkien went on holiday in Switzerland, a trip that he recollects vividly in a 1968 letter[16], noting that Bilbo's journey across the Misty Mountains (""including the glissade down the slithering stones into the pine woods"") is directly based on his adventures as their party of twelve hiked from Interlaken to Lauterbrunnen, and on to camp in the moraines  beyond Mürren. Fifty-seven years later, Tolkien remembers his regret at leaving the view of the eternal snows of Jungfrau and Siilberhorn (""the Silvertine (Celebdil) of my dreams""). They went across the Kleine Scheidegg on to Grindelwald and across the Grosse Scheidegg to Meiringen. They continued across the Grimsel Pass and through the upper Valais to Brig, and on to the Aletsch glacier and Zermatt.

 Young adulthood 
On the evening of his twenty-first birthday, Tolkien wrote to Edith a declaration of his love and asked her to marry him. She replied saying that she was already engaged but had done so because she had believed Tolkien had forgotten her. The two met up and beneath a railway viaduct renewed their love; Edith returned her ring and chose to marry Tolkien instead.[17] Following their engagement Edith converted to Catholicism at Tolkien's insistence.[18] They were engaged in Birmingham, in January 1913, and married in Warwick, England, on March 22, 1916.[19]
With his childhood love of landscape, he visited Cornwall in 1914 and he was said to be deeply impressed by the singular Cornish coastline and sea.[20] After graduating from the University of Oxford (Exeter College, Oxford) with a first-class degree in the English language in 1915, Tolkien joined the British Army effort in World War I and served as a second lieutenant in the eleventh battalion of the Lancashire Fusiliers.[21] His battalion was moved to France in 1916, where Tolkien served as a communications officer during the Battle of the Somme until he came down with trench fever on October 27 and was moved back to England on November 8.[22] Many of his fellow servicemen, as well as many of his closest friends, were killed in the war. During his recovery in a cottage in Great Haywood, Staffordshire, England, he began to work on what he called The Book of Lost Tales, beginning with The Fall of Gondolin. Throughout 1917 and 1918 his illness kept recurring, but he had recovered enough to do home service at various camps and was promoted to lieutenant. When he was stationed at Kingston upon Hull, one day he and Edith went walking in the woods at nearby Roos, and Edith began to dance for him in a thick grove of hemlock; ""We walked in a wood where hemlock was growing, a sea of white flowers"". This incident inspired the account of the meeting of Beren and Lúthien, and Tolkien often referred to Edith as his Lúthien.[23]

 Tenure 
Tolkien's first civilian job after World War I was at the Oxford English Dictionary.[24] In 1920 he took up a post as Reader in the English language at the University of Leeds, and in 1924 was made a professor there, but in 1925 he returned to Oxford as a professor of Anglo-Saxon at Pembroke College.[25]
Tolkien and Edith had four children: John Francis Reuel (November 17, 1917 - January 22, 2003), Michael Hilary Reuel (October 1920–1984), Christopher John Reuel (1924), and Priscilla Anne Reuel (1929). Tolkien assisted Sir Mortimer Wheeler in the unearthing of a Roman Asclepieion at Lydney Park, Gloucestershire, in 1928.[26] During his time at Pembroke, Tolkien wrote The Hobbit and the first two volumes of The Lord of the Rings. Of Tolkien's academic publications, the 1936 lecture ""Beowulf: The Monsters and the Critics"" had a lasting influence on Beowulf research.[27] Lewis E. Nicholson noted that the article Tolkien wrote about Beowulf is ""widely recognized as a turning point in Beowulfian criticism"", noting that Tolkien established the primacy of the poetic nature of the work as opposed to the purely linguistic elements.[28] He also revealed in his famous article how highly he regarded Beowulf; ""Beowulf is among my most valued sources ..."" And indeed, there are many influences of Beowulf found in the Lord of the Rings.[29]

In 1945, he moved to Merton College, Oxford, becoming the Merton Professor of English Language and Literature, in which post he remained until his retirement in 1959. Tolkien completed The Lord of the Rings in 1948, close to a decade after the first sketches. During the 1950s, Tolkien spent many of his long academic holidays at the home of his son John Francis in Stoke-on-Trent.
Tolkien had an intense dislike for the side effects of industrialisation which he considered a devouring of the English countryside. For most of his adult life, he eschewed automobiles, preferring to ride a bicycle.[30] This attitude is perceptible from some parts of his work such as the forced industrialisation of The Shire in The Lord of the Rings.

W.H. Auden was a frequent correspondent and long-time friend of Tolkien's, initiated by Auden's fascination with The Lord of the Rings: Auden was among the most prominent early critics to praise the work. Tolkien wrote in a 1971 letter, ""I am [...] very deeply in Auden's debt in recent years. His support of me and interest in my work has been one of my chief encouragements. He gave me very good reviews, notices, and letters from the beginning when it was by no means a popular thing to do. He was, in fact, sneered at for it."".[31]

 Retirement and old age 
During his life in retirement, from 1959 up to his death in 1973, Tolkien increasingly turned into a figure of public attention and literary fame. The sale of his books was so profitable that Tolkien regretted he had not taken early retirement.[32] While at first, he wrote enthusiastic answers to reader inquiries, he became more and more suspicious of emerging Tolkien fandom, especially among the hippy movement in the USA.[33] In a 1972 letter, he deplores having become a cult-figure, but admits that

even the nose of a very modest idol (younger than Chu-Bu and not much older than Sheemish) cannot remain entirely untickled by the sweet smell of incense!.[34]

Fan attention became so intense that Tolkien had to take his phone number out of the public directory,[35] and eventually he and Edith moved to Bournemouth at the south coast. Tolkien was awarded a CBE by Queen Elizabeth II at Buckingham Palace on March 28, 1972.

    The grave of J. R. R. and Edith Tolkien, Wolvercote Cemetery, Oxford  
Edith Tolkien died on November 29, 1971, at the age of eighty-two, and Tolkien had the name Lúthien engraved on the stone at Wolvercote Cemetery, Oxford. When Tolkien died 21 months later on September 2, 1973, at the age of 81, he was buried in the same grave, with Beren added to his name, so that the engraving now reads: 
Edith Mary Tolkien, Lúthien, 1889 - 1971
John Ronald Reuel Tolkien, Beren, 1892–1973

Posthumously named after Tolkien are the Tolkien Road in Eastbourne, East Sussex, and the asteroid 2675 Tolkien. Tolkien Way in Stoke-on-Trent is named after Tolkien's son Father John Francis Tolkien, who was the priest in charge at the nearby Roman Catholic Church of Our Lady of the Angels and St. Peter in Chains.[36]
 Writing 
    Cover design for the three volumes of The Lord of the Rings by Tolkien  
Beginning with The Book of Lost Tales, written while recuperating from illness during World War I, Tolkien devised several themes that would be reused in initial successive drafts of his legendarium. The two most prominent stories, the tales of Beren and Lúthien and that of Túrin Turambar in the First Age, were carried forward into long narrative poems (published in The Lays of Beleriand). Tolkien wrote a brief summary of the mythology these poems were intended to represent, and that summary eventually evolved into The Silmarillion, an epic history that Tolkien started three times but never published. It was originally to be published along with the Lord of the Rings, but printing costs were very high in the post-war years, later leading to the Lord of the Rings being published in three books.[37] The story of this continuous redrafting is told in the posthumous series The History of Middle-earth. From around 1936, he began to extend this framework to include the tale of The Fall of Númenor, which was inspired by the legend of Atlantis.
Tolkien was strongly influenced by Anglo-Saxon literature, Germanic and Norse mythologies, Finnish mythology, the Bible, and Greek mythology.[38] The works most often cited as sources for Tolkien's stories include Beowulf, the Kalevala, the Poetic Edda, the Volsunga saga and the Hervarar saga.[39] Tolkien himself acknowledged Homer, Oedipus, and the Kalevala as influences or sources for some of his stories and ideas.[40] His borrowings also came from numerous Middle English works and poems. A major philosophical influence on his writing is King Alfred's Anglo-Saxon version of Boethius' Consolation of Philosophy known as the Lays of Boethius.[41] Characters in The Lord of the Rings such as Frodo, Treebeard, and Elrond make noticeably Boethian remarks.
In addition to his mythological compositions, Tolkien enjoyed inventing fantasy stories to entertain his children.[42] He wrote annual Christmas letters from Father Christmas for them, building up a series of short stories (later compiled and published as The Father Christmas Letters). Other stories included Mr. Bliss, Roverandom, Smith of Wootton Major, Farmer Giles of Ham, and Leaf by Niggle. Roverandom and Smith of Wootton Major, like The Hobbit, borrowed ideas from his legendarium. Leaf by Niggle appears to be an autobiographical work, where a ""very small man"", Niggle, keeps painting leaves until finally, he ends up with a tree.[43]
Tolkien never expected his fictional stories to become popular, but he was persuaded by C.S. Lewis to publish a book he had written for his own children called The Hobbit in 1937.[44] However, the book attracted adult readers as well, and it became popular enough for the publisher, Allen & Unwin, to ask Tolkien to work on a sequel.
Even though he felt uninspired on the topic, this request prompted Tolkien to begin what would become his most famous work: the epic three-volume novel The Lord of the Rings (published 1954–55). Tolkien spent more than ten years writing the primary narrative and appendices for The Lord of the Rings, during which time he received the constant support of The Inklings, in particular his closest friend C.S. Lewis, the author of The Chronicles of Narnia. Both The Hobbit and The Lord of the Rings are set against the background of The Silmarillion, but in a time long after it.
Tolkien at first intended The Lord of the Rings as a children's tale like The Hobbit, but it quickly grew darker and more serious in the writing.[45] Though a direct sequel to The Hobbit, it addressed an older audience, drawing on the immense back story of Beleriand that Tolkien had constructed in previous years, and which eventually saw posthumous publication in The Silmarillion and other volumes. Tolkien's influence weighs heavily on the fantasy genre that grew up after the success of The Lord of the Rings.
Tolkien continued to work on the history of Middle-earth until his death. His son Christopher, with some assistance from fantasy writer Guy Gavriel Kay, organized some of this material into one volume, published as The Silmarillion in 1977. In 1980 Christopher Tolkien followed this with a collection of more fragmentary material under the title Unfinished Tales, and in subsequent years he published a massive amount of background material on the creation of Middle-earth in the twelve volumes of The History of Middle-earth.
All these posthumous works contain unfinished, abandoned, alternative and outright contradictory accounts, since they were always a work in progress, and Tolkien only rarely settled on a definitive version for any of the stories. There is not even complete consistency to be found between The Lord of the Rings and The Hobbit, the two most closely related works because Tolkien was never able to fully integrate all their traditions into each other. He commented in 1965 while editing The Hobbit for a third edition, that he would have preferred to completely rewrite the entire book.[46]
The Lord of the Rings became immensely popular in the 1960s and has remained so ever since, ranking as one of the most popular works of fiction of the twentieth century, judged by both sales and reader surveys.[47] In the 2003 ""Big Read"" survey conducted by the BBC, The Lord of the Rings was found to be the ""Nation's Best-loved Book"". Australians voted The Lord of the Rings ""My Favourite Book"" in a 2004 survey conducted by the Australian ABC.[48] In a 1999 poll of Amazon.com customers, The Lord of the Rings was judged to be their favourite ""book of the millennium"".[49] In 2002 Tolkien was voted the ninety-second ""greatest Briton"" in a poll conducted by the BBC, and in 2004 he was voted thirty-fifth in the SABC3's Great South Africans, the only person to appear in both lists. His popularity is not limited just to the English-speaking world: in a 2004 poll inspired by the UK’s ""Big Read"" survey, about 250,000 Germans found The Lord of the Rings (Der Herr der Ringe) to be their favourite work of literature.[50]
Humphrey Carpenter chronicled all of Tolkien's published poems and writings in ""Appendix C"" of his authorized biography, J.R.R. Tolkien: A Biography (1977).
Six of Tolkien's major academic lectures, such as his important 1936 lecture on Beowulf, and one essay were compiled into The Monsters and the Critics and other essays in 1983 by Christopher Tolkien.

 Manuscripts 
Early drafts of The Lord of the Rings (initially titled ""The Magic Ring"") were sold to Marquette University in Milwaukee, Wisconsin, in 1956 for 1,500 pounds sterling (about $4,700). Over 11,000 pages were included, text and a few illustrations.[51] Other original material survives at Oxford's Bodleian Library. Marquette has the manuscripts and proofs of The Hobbit, and other manuscripts including Farmer Giles of Ham, while the Bodleian holds The Silmarillion papers and Tolkien's academic work.[52]
As of the 2000's, many of his manuscripts have been featured in the publications Tolkien: Maker of Middle-earth (2017) and The Art of The Lord of the Rings by J.R.R. Tolkien (2015).

Both Tolkien's academic career and his literary production are inseparable from his love of language and philology. He specialized in Greek philology in college, and in 1915 graduated with Old Icelandic as a special subject. He contributed to the Oxford English Dictionary in 1918. Two years later he went to Leedswhere he claimed credit for raising the number of students of linguistics from five to twenty. He gave courses in Old English heroic verse, history of English, various Old English and Middle English texts, Old and Middle English philology, introductory Germanic philology, Gothic, Old Icelandic, and Medieval Welsh. When in 1925, aged 33, Tolkien applied for the Rawlinson and Bosworth Professorship of Anglo-Saxon, he boasted that his students of Germanic philology in Leeds had even formed a ""Viking Club"".[53]
Privately, Tolkien was attracted to ""things of racial and linguistic significance"", and he entertained notions of an inherited taste of language, which he termed the ""native tongue"" as opposed to ""cradle tongue"" in his 1955 lecture English and Welsh, which is crucial to his understanding of race and language. He considered west-midland Middle English his own ""native tongue"", and, as he wrote to W. H. Auden in 1955,[54] ""I am a West-Midlander by blood (and took to early west-midland Middle English as a known tongue as soon as I set eyes on it)""
Parallel to Tolkien's professional work as a philologist, and sometimes overshadowing this work, to the effect that his academic output remained rather thin, was his affection for the construction of artificial languages. The best developed of these are Quenya and Sindarin, the etymological connection between which are at the core of much of Tolkien's legendarium. Language and grammar for Tolkien were a matter of aesthetics and euphony, and Quenya in particular were designed from ""phonaesthetic"" considerations; it was intended as an ""Elvenlatin"": phonologically based on Latin with ingredients from Finnish and Greek.[55] A notable addition came in late 1945 with Numenorean, a language of a ""faintly Semitic flavour"", connected with Tolkien's Atlantis myth, which by The Notion Club Papers ties directly into his ideas about the inheritability of language, and via the ""Second Age"" and the Eärendil myth was grounded in the legendarium, thereby providing a link of Tolkien's twentieth-century ""real primary world"" with the mythical past of his Middle-earth.

 Biography 
    Arrival of Eärendil and birds by Manuel Castañón  
After Eärendil made his journey to Valinor to convince the Valar to overthrow Morgoth and rescue the overmatched and defeated Elves and Edain, The Host of Valinor made war upon Morgoth and destroyed his armies. 
Facing final defeat, Morgoth unleashed his last and greatest weapon; a fleet of winged fire drakes, led by Ancalagon. So terrible was their onslaught that the armies of the Valar were driven back from the gates of Angband, and their coming was said to have been accompanied by a tempest of fire and lightning.
But Eärendil came out of the West in his blessed ship Vingilot, accompanied by ""a myriad"" of the Eagles of Manwë led by Thorondor. The Eagles and Eärendil dueled with Ancalagon and the other dragons for a day. Eventually, Eärendil was victorious, casting Ancalagon down upon Thangorodrim and destroying the volcanic mountains in his fall. The death of Ancalagon marked the end of Morgoth's final resistance.[2]

Later mentions
Gandalf spoke of him as he told Frodo the true origin of his Ring. ""It has been said that dragon-fire could melt and consume the Rings of Power, but there is not now any dragon left on earth in which the old fire is hot enough; nor was there ever any dragon, not even Ancalagon the Black, who could have harmed the One Ring, the Ruling Ring, for that was made by Sauron himself.""[3]

Etymology
The name Ancalagon is Sindarin, meaning ""Rushing Jaws"" from anca (""jaws"") and the root alak- (""rushing"").[4]

 Other names 
The Middle English translation for Ancalagon is Andracca, from and- (""opposition""), anda (""hatred, envy""), and draca (""dragon"").[5]

Ancalagon's size is not specified, but must have been colossal due to the destruction of ""the towers of Thangorodrim"" when he fell on them, which are elsewhere identified with the three smoking peaks of those mountains.[6] However, his size cannot be assumed to be larger than Thangorodrim; some powerful but comparatively small creatures are able to cause great destruction even in death, such as Durin's Bane breaking the slopes of Celebdil.
Like all other Urulóki, Ancalagon breathed fire, which was implied to be hotter than any other dragon's flame.[7]

 Trivia 
In 1977, an extinct genus of worms found in the The Walcott Quarry on Fossil Ridge in 1911 dating from the Middle Cambrian Era from the Cambrian Burgess Shale was named Ancalagon, inspired by Tolkien's dragon.[8]

""I am Aragorn son of Arathorn, and am called Elessar, the Elfstone, Dúnadan, the heir of Isildur Elendil's son of Gondor. Here is the sword that was broken and is forged again! ""
—Aragorn, speaking to Éomer in The Two Towers, The Riders of Rohan

Aragorn II, son of Arathorn II and Gilraen, also known as Elessar and Strider, was the 16th Chieftain of the Dúnedain of the North; later crowned King Elessar Telcontar (March 1, 2931 - FO 120 or SR 1541), the 26th King of Arnor and 35th King of Gondor - and first High King of Gondor and Arnor since the short reign of Isildur. He was a great ranger and warrior, and as Isildur's heir he bore the shards of Narsil, reforged and renamed Andúril, Flame of the West, in the War of the Ring.

 Biography 
 Early years 
    Aragorn as a toddler, portrayed by Luke Johnston in the fan film Born of Hope  
He was Aragorn son of Arathorn, the nine and thirtieth heir in the right line from Isildur, and yet more like Elendil than any before him.—The Silmarillion, Of the Rings of Power and the Third Age
Aragorn was a descendant of Elros Tar-Minyatur. His ancestor Arvedui was wedded to Fíriel, who was descended from Anárion, who bore their son Aranarth, making Aragorn the last descendant of Anárion as well.
When he was only two years old, his father Arathorn was killed while pursuing orcs. Aragorn was afterwards fostered in Rivendell by Elrond. At the request of his mother, his lineage was kept secret, as she feared he would be killed like his father and grandfather if his true identity as the descendant of Elendil and Heir of Isildur became known. Aragorn was renamed ""Estel"" and was not told about his heritage until 2951.[1]

    Young Aragorn with the shards of Narsil, by Anna Lee  
Elrond revealed to ""Estel"" his true name and ancestry when he was twenty, and gave to him the Ring of Barahir and the Shards of Narsil. Elrond withheld the Sceptre of Annúminas from Aragorn until he ""came of the right"" to possess the item. It was also around this time that Aragorn met and fell in love with Arwen, Elrond's daughter, newly returned from her mother's homeland of Lórien where she had visited her grandmother Galadriel.[1]
Aragorn thereafter assumed his proper role as the sixteenth Chieftain of the Dúnedain and the Rangers of the North, and left the comforts of Rivendell for the wild, where he lived with the remainder of his people, whose kingdom had been destroyed through civil and regional wars centuries before.[1]
Aragorn met Gandalf the Grey in 2956 and they became close friends. Heeding Gandalf's advice, Aragorn and the Rangers began to guard a small land known as the Shire inhabited by the diminutive and agrarian Hobbits, and he became known among the peoples just outside the Shire's borders as Strider.
From TA 2957 to TA 2980, Aragorn undertook great journeys, serving in the armies of King Thengel of Rohan, and Steward Ecthelion II of Gondor. Many of his tasks helped to raise morale in the West and counter the growing threat of Sauron and his allies, and he earned priceless experience which he would later put to use in the War of the Ring. Aragorn served his lords in disguise and his name in Gondor and Rohan during that time was Thorongil (""Eagle of the Star""). With a small Gondor squadron of ships, he led an assault on the long-standing rebel province of Umbar in 2980, burning many of the Corsairs' ships and personally slaying their lord during the battle on the Havens. After the victory at Umbar, ""Thorongil"" left the field and, to the dismay of his men, went east.[2]
Later in 2980, he visited Lórien, and there once again met Arwen. He gave her the heirloom of his House, the Ring of Barahir, and, on the hill of Cerin Amroth, Arwen pledged her hand to him in marriage, renouncing her elvish lineage and accepting the Gift of Men; death.[1]
Elrond withheld from Aragorn permission to marry his daughter until such a time as his foster son should be king of ""both"" Gondor and Arnor. As both Elrond and Aragorn knew, to marry a mortal, Arwen would be required to choose mortality, and thus deprive the deathless Elrond of his daughter while the world lasted. Elrond was also concerned for Arwen's own happiness, fearing that in the end she might find death (her own and that of her beloved) too difficult to bear.[1]

Before the events of The Lord of the Rings properly take place, Aragorn also traveled through the Dwarven mines of Moria, to Harad, where (in his own words) ""the stars are strange"". Tolkien does not specify when these travels occurred nor does he indicate what happens when Aragorn visits.    Aragorn the Ranger in the wild, from the fan film The Hunt for Gollum  In 3009, Gandalf grew suspicious of the origin of the ring belonging to the Hobbit Bilbo Baggins, which later turned out to be the One Ring, the source of the Dark Lord Sauron's evil power. Aragorn went at his request into Rhovanion in search of Gollum, who had once possessed the Ring. He caught the creature in the Dead Marshes near Mordor, and brought him as a captive to Thranduil's halls in Mirkwood, where Gandalf questioned him.[3] Gollum, however, escaped some time later with the aid of Sauron's Orcs.
 War of the Ring 
What his right name is I've never heard: but he's known round here as Strider.—Barliman Butterbur, speaking of Aragorn in The Fellowship of the Ring, ""At the Sign of the Prancing Pony""

 Escorting the hobbits 
    Strider at The Prancing Pony in Bree  
Aragorn returned with Gandalf in the spring of TA 3018, and then went away on his own journey, and was not able to help when Gandalf discovered the Nazgul were seeking for Frodo and the Ring in the Shire. After Frodo left Hobbiton, Gildor informed Aragorn that the Nine were looking for him and Gandalf was missing. Aragorn continued to watch the Great East Road until Tom Bombadil and the four hobbits came from the Barrow Downs. Following them to Bree, he met Frodo at Inn of the Prancing Pony under the name ""Strider,"" as the Men of Bree called him.[4] Though originally the hobbits were suspicious of him, Barliaman Butterbur brought a letter from Gandalf that made them trust him.[5] Aragorn was aged 87 at that time, nearing the prime of life for one of royal Númenórean descent.
After the raid on Bree, Aragorn led them out of Bree-land and through the Midgewater Marshes. While there, he saw Gandalf's battle with the Nazgul on Weathertop. When they themselves came to Weathertop, they discovered the Nazgul had followed them, and during the later attack he fought off the five ringwraiths. After attempting to heal Frodo with athelas, he led them accross the Lone-lands towards the Trollshaws.[6] The elf-lord Glorfindel later arrived and led them to the Ford of Bruinen. When the Nazgul caught up with them and Elrond released a flood, Aragorn and the Hobbits kindled fire and flushed out those Nazgul that had remained on the western bank. He then accompanied Frodo to Rivendell.[7]
During the feast of victory, Aragorn was gathering news from Elladan and Elrohir, and later helped Bilbo compose his Lay of Earendil. During the Council of Elrond, he revealed himself to Boromir as their heir of Isildur and described his capture of Gollum. After Elrond decided to destroy the Ring in Mordor, Frodo took the burden upon himself.There, Aragorn chose to join Frodo, thus forming the Fellowship of the Ring that was formed to guard Frodo, tasked with destroying the Ring in the fires of Mount Doom in Mordor. Besides Aragorn, Gandalf, and Frodo, the company included Frodo's cousins Pippin and Merry, his best friend Samwise Gamgee, Legolas the elf, Gimli the Dwarf, and Boromir of Gondor.[3]


All that is gold does not glitter,
Not all those who wander are lost;
The old that is strong does not wither,
Deep roots are not reached by the frost.
From the ashes a fire shall be woken,
A light from the shadows shall spring;
Renewed shall be Blade that was Broken,
The crownless again shall be king.


— Bilbo's poem about Aragorn[5]

Before the group set out, the shards of Narsil were reforged, and the restored blade was named Andúril.

 Accompanying the Fellowship 



""And while I can honestly say I have told you the truth, I may not have told you all of it."" 
At least part of this article or section is of insufficient length or lacking important details. Please

Aragorn and Gandalf had been planning their journey to Mordor for weeks. He and Gandalf guided the Fellowship south along the line of the Misty Mountains. When they came to Hollin, Aragorn grew suspicious due to the lack of any sound he heard and spotted the Crebain who were spying out the land for Saruman. He then convinced Gandalf to try the pass over Caradhras. However, while they were still far down the mountain, they were caught in a freak storm brought on by Saruman, and were forced to retreat. Aragorn, together with Boromir, made a path through the snow for the fellowship to escape.
After it was proposed to go through Moria, Aragorn reluctantly agreed to go and helped fight off the wargs that attacked them during the night. During their marches, Aragorn remained at the back and noticed Gollum beginning to follow the company. After they were attacked in the Chamber of Mazarbul, Aragorn fought off the attackers and killed the Orc-Chieftain, (or Cave-troll in the movies) that had seemingly killed Frodo. During Gandalf's battle with the Balrog on the Bridge of Khazad-dûm, Aragorn ran to his side and became the Fellowship's leader after Gandalf fell, presumed dead.[8] Aragorn then led the company to Lórien, where he visited Cerin Amroth for the last time. At their parting, Lady Galadriel gave him the Elfstone.[9]
After Lórien, Aragorn and the Fellowship sailed down the river Anduin to the Falls of Rauros. Aragorn attempted to catch Gollum several times. Though his original plan was to set out for Gondor and aid its people in the war, he felt responsible for Frodo after the loss of Gandalf.[10]

 Breaking of the Fellowship 
Fear not! he said. ""Long have I desired to look upon the likenesses of Isildur and Anarion, my sires of old. Under their shadow Elessar, the Elfstone son of Arathorn of the House of Valandil Isildur's son heir of Elendil, has naught to dread!— Aragorn proclaiming his lineage[10]""    Aragorn saying goodbye to Boromir after his death  
After passing into the Argonath, the Fellowship camped in Amon Hen. Frodo saw that Boromir had been driven mad by the influence of the One Ring trying to take it. Frodo put the ring on, rendering him invisible, and ran away from Boromir. Frodo climbed to the high seat on Amon Hen; from there he could see Sauron's eye looking for him. The Hobbit felt the eye but it was distracted by Gandalf the White, later found near Fangorn Forest by Aragorn, Legolas, and Gimli during their search for Merry and Pippin.[citation needed]","

""Once he was as great as his fame made him. His knowledge was deep, his thought was subtle, and his hands marvelously skilled; and he had a power over the minds of others. The wise he could persuade, and the smaller folk he could daunt. That power he certainly still keeps. There are not many in Middle-earth that I should say were safe, if they were left alone to talk with him, even now when he has suffered a defeat. Gandalf, Elrond, and Galadriel, perhaps, now that his wickedness has been laid bare, but very few others.""
—Aragorn, The Two Towers, ""Flotsam and Jetsam""

Saruman (Quenya; IPA: ['saruman] - ""Man Of Skill""), also known as Saruman the White was the first of the order of Istar (wizard), who came to Middle-earth as Emissaries of the Valar in the Third Age. He also was the leader of the wizards and of the White Council that opposed Sauron. His extensive studies of dark magic, however, eventually led him to desire the One Ring. Thinking he could gain it for himself or become Sauron's servant alone, Saruman allied Isengard with Mordor in the War of the Ring, in which he was defeated.
He studied deeply the arts of Sauron, the better to intially oppose him, but he soon became enamored of the Dark Lord's devices, especially the One Ring. He betrayed his mission and came to view the future of Middle-earth under his or Sauron's dominion. While coveting the Ring, Saruman kept the pretense of allegiance to the Enemy. But his plans came to nought, and his power was broken in the Battle of the Hornburg and the Battle of Isengard.
Before his fall, he was the chief of both the wizards and of the White Council (a league of all those opposed to Sauron). His knowledge and skill, especially of Sauron's devices, was said to be great. However, his deep study of the Rings of Power and Sauron's other magic corrupted him, and his overweening lust for power led to his downfall. Though not truly faithful to his master, Saruman unintentionally fell deeper under Sauron's sway by delving into Ring-lore and betraying the Valar. He is one of the few characters in Middle-earth who is morally ""grey"" - being neither a genuine servant of evil nor an agent of good. He ultimately trusts only his own counsel and schemes for his own ends.

 Biography 
 Years of the Lamps 
    Saruman as the Maia Curumo before leaving Valinor  
Saruman was originally one of the powerful Maia of Aulë the Smith - just like Mairon once was until this one fell and became Sauron - named Curumo (later in Sindarin, Curunír).[1] In Valinor, the land of the Valar, a council was called by Manwë, leader of the Valar, shortly after Sauron's defeat by the Last Alliance of Elves and Men. Though Sauron was overthrown, it would later turn out that he had not been effectively vanquished and his shadow began to fall upon Middle-earth a second time. It was decided to send five emissaries to Middle-earth. These should be ""mighty, peers of Sauron, yet forgo might, and clothe themselves in flesh,"" as they were intended to help Men and Elves unite against Sauron, but the wizards were forbidden from matching the Dark Lord in power and fear.[2]
Curumo was one of those who volunteered, whereas the last one, Olórin, (later Gandalf) was commanded by Manwë to go too. It was from this point that Curumo began to be jealous of Olorin, due to Varda's decision to send Olorin not as the third Istari, but as the second. He also was in charge of take Aiwendil (later Radagast) to please Yavanna, which Curumo did not wish to do, and this led to contempt for the latter Wizard. The other who were chosen were Alatar and Pallando (the Blue Wizards). Curumo then was appointed overall leader of the group.[2]

 Third Age 
 Arrival in Middle-earth 
    The arrival of the Istari in Middle-earth  
The five wizards arrived at the Grey Havens in the west of Eriador around the year 1000. Only the keeper of the havens, Círdan the Shipwright, knew Saruman's identity and origin. Saruman would later discover that Círdan had given Narya, the Red Ring, to Gandalf upon their first landing in Middle-earth. Even though Saruman was immediately considered the head of the order while Gandalf was not, Círdan had divined Gandalf as the wisest and greatest of the wizards. Saruman's jealousy of Gandalf grew from these events, perhaps because he feared that he would eventually supplant him as chief of wizards.
Saruman and the two Blue Wizards went into the east of Middle-earth. After one and a half millennia, he returned to the west, just as Sauron's power was growing again in Dol Guldur.

 The White Council 
When the White Council was formed at approximately year 2463 of the Third Age in order to counter Sauron, Saruman was appointed its leader, though Galadriel wanted Gandalf in this position. Saruman refused to step down due to his pride, while Gandalf had declined. At this point Saruman had begun to sense the resurgence of Sauron and to envy and desire his power, and especially the One Ring. This was also the same year that the One Ring was taken by the Halfling Sméagol (later called Gollum), who disappeared with it into the Misty Mountains for hundreds of years. It was during the meetings of the Council that Saruman first noted Gandalf's interest in Hobbits and The Shire, and believing that all his deeds related to some as yet undisclosed plan of his for self-enhancement, Saruman himself began keeping a greater watch on Gandalf and sent spies to The Shire. At first, he himself visited it secretly but stopped when he realized that its inhabitants had noticed him. Amongst the purposes of his visits was to procure some of the halflings' Pipe-weed, since in secret imitation of Gandalf he had begun to smoke.

 At Isengard 
A new power is rising. Against it the old allies and policies will not avail us at all. There is no hope left in Elves or dying Numenor. This then is one choice before you, before us. We may join with that Power. It would be wise, Gandalf. There is hope that way. Its victory is at hand; and there will be rich reward for those that aided it.—Saruman, speaking to Gandalf - The Fellowship of the Ring, ""The Council of Elrond""

    Saruman the White, by 1oshuart  
In the year TA 2759, Saruman settled in Isengard with the permission of the Steward of Gondor, Beren, although he settled only as Warden of the Tower and representative of the Steward (the stronghold had by then been abandoned by Gondor). There he became important in the informal alliance defending the west of Middle-earth. In the tower of Isengard, Orthanc, he also found one of the remaining Palantíri.
In TA 2850, Gandalf entered Dol Guldur and confirmed that the evil presence was indeed Sauron. By Saruman's advice, the White Council decided against attacking Dol Guldur. Gandalf would later remark that it was at this council meeting that he first began to suspect that Saruman desired to possess the One Ring. Saruman's real intention was to permit Sauron to build up his strength, so that the One Ring would reveal itself. He later found that Sauron had more knowledge of the possible location of the One Ring than he expected, and in TA 2941, Saruman finally agreed to attack Dol Guldur. The attack was successful, and by the devices of Saruman, Sauron was driven from the fortress.
Ten years after Sauron abandoned Dol Guldur, he returned to Mordor and declared himself openly. He established contact with Saruman through the Palantír captured from Minas Ithil, which had since become known as Minas Morgul. The White Wizard lost the contest of wills with the Dark Lord and was enticed, becoming a servant of Sauron. He no longer opposed him, but desired his victory (though he retained his desire for the Ruling Ring). In preparation for the war, Saruman amassed a mighty army of Orcs, Uruk-hai, Half-orcs, wicked Men and Wolves within Isengard and kept up the façade of his allegiance to Sauron while searching for the Ring. Little did he know that his master was already aware of his thoughts, despite having failed to dominate him fully.  
When Gandalf presented Saruman with the discovery and the location of the One Ring, Saruman revealed his desire for it and him being in thrall to Sauron. He had also shed the title of Saruman the White; Saruman no longer had any loyalty to the White Council, or the Ring-bearer. He tried unsuccessfully to gain Gandalf's aid. When Gandalf refused to join with either him or Sauron, Saruman held him captive in Isengard. Gandalf later escaped with help from Gwaihir the Windlord, one of Middle-earth's large Eagles, and made Saruman's treachery known to the rest of the White Council.

 The Beginning of the End 
    Saruman making a bomb in his tower, Orthanc  
By one account, the Nazgûl came two days after Gandalf's escape and Saruman used his Voice to persuade the Lord of the Nazgûl that he did not know the Ring's location but that Gandalf did and they should seek him nearby. After the Nazgûl heard this they went back on the main road rode along and instead found Gríma Wormtongue (who was on his way to tell Saruman that Gandalf had been to Edoras) who revealed that Saruman was hiding his knowledge of the Shire from them, proving that the wizard's allegiance to Sauron was as genuine as he outright presented it. 
By another account, Saruman only discovered that Gandalf had escaped when the Nazgûl arrived. He had been, according to this account, about to beg Gandalf for forgiveness and help, only to find him gone. To evade the danger at hand and enticed by the thought of being Sauron's servant alone or gaining the Ring, he pretended that Gandalf was still there and that the latter had just been forced to tell the location of the Shire. The Nazgûl later learned that Saruman knew far more than he had revealed. On their way to the Shire, the Nazgûl met one of the wizard's informants in Eriador, from whom they got detailed maps of the Shire made by Saruman. They sent the spy back to the Shire after warning him that he was now in the service of Mordor (the Dunlending in the Inn of the Prancing Pony). 
Believing that he would find no pity from either quarter (a false assumption, since he was later offered pardon by Gandalf) and that he had lost chance of rising in Sauron's favour; Saruman now put all efforts into obtaining the One Ring for himself. Not all of these efforts ever became known, but they included sending spies to waylay Frodo Baggins on his flight from the Shire (Bill Ferny in Bree), attacking Rohan outright with Orcs and dispatching raiding parties of Uruk-hai accompanied by Orcs from the Misty Mountains on likely routes the Fellowship of the Ring might take through Rohan to go towards Gondor. One of those companies captured Pippin and Merry and shot Boromir ""with many black-feathered arrows"" when he tried to defend the Hobbits. This led Aragorn, Legolas, and Gimli on a search which eventually led to the Battle of Helms Deep as well as the Destruction of Isengard by the Ents under Treebeard, leading to Sauron losing one of his most potent servants and the end of Saruman's reign of terror in the north.

 Power destroyed 
You have become a fool, Saruman, and yet pitiable. You might still have turned away from folly and evil, and have been of service. But you choose to stay and gnaw the ends of your old plots. Stay then! But I warn you, you will not easily come out again. Not unless the dark hands of the east stretch out to take you!—Gandalf the White

    Saruman looks down upon Gandalf from the Pinnacle of Orthanc  
Following the Ents' destruction of Isengard, Saruman found himself confined to Orthanc and his servants scattered or killed. After the arrival of Théoden, Gandalf, Aragorn, and the remaining members of the Fellowship, Saruman made one final unsuccessful attempt to turn Théoden and Gandalf over to evil. The latter then offered Saruman a chance for redemption, which involved surrendering his staff and the Keys of Orthanc as a pledge. Saruman had a moment of doubt but in the end pride, anger, envy, fear and hate won over and he refused the chance of redemption.

    Saruman's staff broken by Gandalf  
Gandalf, who had returned from death to supplant Saruman, as the White and the head of the Wizard, expelled Saruman from the order and broke his staff. Saruman also lost the Palantír of Orthanc when Gríma Wormtongue threw it off a balcony of Orthanc, undecided about which he hated more, Saruman or Gandalf, and hitting neither.

 Final fall 
Left out of the final stages of the War of the Ring, Saruman eventually managed to persuade the Ents who kept him captive into letting him leave Isengard after he met the conditions of handing over the Keys of Orthanc. He then went to the Shire, which his ally Lotho Sackville-Baggins had brought under control. He spent his final days as a small-time criminal master in Hobbiton known as Sharkey (from the Orkish sharkû, meaning ""old man""), until he was overthrown in the Battle of Bywater. In the aftermath of that battle Frodo confronted Saruman and exiled him from the Shire, but before he could leave, Gríma Wormtongue killed Saruman by slitting his throat with a dagger, on the very doorstep of Bag End.

 Legacy 
After his departure from Orthanc, King Elessar entered the tower with the intent of re-ordering that realm. Inside, Elessar's men found many treasures that Saruman had conned off of King Théoden. There was a secret closet that could only be found with the aid of Gimli; it contained the original Elendilmir, which had presumed to be lost forever when Isildur perished in the Gladden Fields, as well as a golden chain which was presumed to have once borne the One Ring.[3]

 Fate 
Saruman, being a Maia, did not truly die. His spirit separated from his body much like his master Sauron's after the Downfall of Númenor. As an incorporeal spirit, he should have been called to the Halls of Mandos, but the tale implies that he was barred from returning. Tolkien indicated that his spirit was left naked, powerless and wandering, never to return to Middle-earth:
Whereas Curunir was cast down, and utterly humbled, and perished at last by the hand of an oppressed slave; and his spirit went whither-soever it was doomed to go, and to Middle-earth, whether naked or embodied, came never back.—Saruman's fate

 Names 
Curumo is the Quenya name for Saruman. Its Tengwar spelling is aU7Ut^, and its IPA pronunciation is [ˈkurumo].
Curunír is the Sindarin name for Saruman the White. It roughly translates to mean ""man of skill"". Curunir was the original name given to Saruman as the leader of the Wizards, or Istari, who first came to Middle-earth to combat the evils of Sauron. Late in the Third Age around the time of the War of the Ring, this name was less known and rarely used save among the Elves and even rarely used by them except for their leaders, such as Elrond in Rivendell, Celeborn and Galadriel in Lothlórien, and Círdan at the Grey Havens.
Saruman as called by Gandalf, Men in Rohan, and Men in most other places.
Sharku is the name given to him by his Uruk-Hai meaning in Black Speech ""Old Man"".
Sharkey, a form of the word is later used by the Ruffians at the Shire, from ""Sharku"".

 Powers and abilities 
Saruman's status as chief of the Wizards and head of the White Council (before Gandalf) gave him arsenal to a variety of powers. Though he would eventually be defeated by Gandalf the White, Saruman's powers and abilities were very mighty indeed at the peak of his power, and he managed to imprison Gandalf the Grey. Gandalf described Saruman as an individual of great knowledge, cunning, and skill. He was capably of breeding his own Uruk-hai, and had many spies, be they walking on two legs or birds, that escaped detection. He was extremely learned in Ringlore and mechanics, and his knowledge enabled him to create great forges and explosives that could breach the walls of Helm's Deep and burn an Ent to death. Unfortunately, it was Saruman's extensive knowledge of the Rings of Power that was one of the reason leading to his downfall, as he became enamored of the power of the rings, and particularly the One Ring.
He was well-versed in magic, one spell he displayed giving speed and strength to the Orcs who had kidnapped Merry and Pippin while obstructing Aragorn, Legolas and Gimli. By far Saruman's greatest power (and the only one he was able to retain after the downfall of Isengard), however, is speech. He seems to have the ability to bend any but the absolute strongest minds to his will, simply by speaking to them. Even with Isengard broken and Saruman's treachery revealed, Gandalf had to be very careful, Saruman could ensnare almost anyone with the power of his voice, few can contend with his will. Gandalf was not drawn into this power when he confronted Saruman; in trying to enchant some in the company, he left others out of his designs, and thus could not ensnare everyone at once. However, even in this situation, it is said that only Gandalf himself remained totally unmoved. Aragorn stated during this time that few other than Gandalf, Elrond and Galadriel could resist his voice, even at this point. Saruman later used his persuasive power to escape Orthanc, convincing Treebeard to let him go.

—Saruman and Gandalf, The Fellowship of the Ring film adaptation

 The Lord of the Rings film trilogy 
    Saruman falling to his death from Orthanc  
In Peter Jackson's first film trilogy, Saruman is played by Sir Christopher Lee and is the secondary antagonist of The Fellowship of the Ring and primary antagonist of The Two Towers. Unlike in the novels, his allegiance to Sauron is genuine and he is portrayed plainly as a servant carrying out Sauron's will. He is referred to only as ""the White,"" omitting his title of ""Saruman of Many Colours."" Lee is the only cast member to ever have met Tolkien.
By the beginning of The Fellowship of the Ring, Saruman reveals that he has been utterly enslaved by the will of Sauron and by his own thirst for power. When Gandalf refuses to join Mordor, he imprisons him in Orthanc. Instructed by his master to build him ""an army worthy of Mordor"", Saruman gathers his Orcs and begins the preparations for war: constructing dams and wooden machinery, fortifying the ringed walls of Isengard, forging arms and breeding Uruk-hai. He confronts Gandalf once more atop Orthanc, trying to coerce him into submitting to Sauron, only for the Grey Pilgrim to flee. Saruman tracks the Fellowship using Crebain and summons massive snow avalanches and rock-slides to try and hinder the heroes at Caradhras. Uruk-hai in service to Saruman attack the Fellowship at the conclusion of the film, killing Boromir and capturing Merry and Pippin. Saruman's interactions with Gandalf also were toned down in the movie compared to in the books, where he was shown to interact with Gandalf in a genuinely friendly manner, as well as appearing to accept that Gandalf chose death over serving Sauron with some sadness, whereas even before his allegiance to Sauron was revealed, he barely hid his contempt for Gandalf with sarcastic barbs.
In The Two Towers, Saruman leads his master's conquest in the West of Middle-earth. He allies himself with the Dunlendings who join his Orc parties and burn the Westfold, then amasses an Uruk-hai army of 10,000 to destroy Rohan. He is aided by Gríma Wormtongue and is depicted as having outright possessed Théoden. At the climax of the film, Saruman's army is defeated at Helm's Deep and Isengard is overrun by Ents.
Saruman does not appear in the theatrical cut of The Return of the King; Treebeard only suggests that the fallen wizard's power is no more. In the extended edition, Gandalf, Aragorn, Théoden, Gimli, Merry and Pippin confront Saruman in Isengard at the beginning of the film. Gandalf wishes to interrogate Saruman, but Gríma stabs Saruman at the pinnacle of Orthanc. As Saruman falls to his death, he drops the Palantir.
The Scouring of the Shire, which is where Saruman meets his end in the novels, is entirely omitted from the film adaptations, although certain actions such as Saruman being killed by Grima before the latter was felled by an arrow did reference the event indirectly. Jackson considered the Scouring anticlimactic.

    ToyBiz version of Saruman  
Peter Jackson's trilogy explicitly shows Saruman influencing the weather to create the snowstorm on Caradhras that defeated the Fellowship's efforts to cross the mountains there, although the book didn't even suggest that. Though Boromir thought the storm and falling boulders might be caused by some evil, saying ""there are fell voices on the air; and these stones are aimed at us,"" Aragorn and Gandalf believed it was just the forces of nature that might be expected on ""Caradhras the Cruel.""[4] On a similar note, he also was shown in the films to display telepathy, as he taunted Gandalf about going through the mines and implying that Gandalf was already aware that the Dwarves had awoken a Balgrog; and in the film version of The Two Towers, Saruman uses telepathy to directly possess King Theoden, as Gandalf tries and succeeds in exorcising his influence.
In the films, Saruman's staff of power is a resemblance to his own tower, Orthanc, with a white crystal set between the spires. As a talisman of his authority, it is also used as a walking stick. He uses it to duel Gandalf the Grey. Gandalf the White destroys Saruman's staff effortlessly in The Return of the King extended edition shortly after Saruman's failed attempt at scorching Gandalf.

 The Hobbit film trilogy 
    ""Who is that odd little fellow?"" - Sir Christopher Lee during the shooting of The Hobbit  
Sir Christopher Lee reprised the role in Peter Jackson's live action The Hobbit trilogy. He originally expressed interest in voicing Smaug the dragon, but the role ended up going to Benedict Cumberbatch. Christopher Lee also managed to humour Peter Jackson by asking him ""Am I still in the movie?"" This refers to when Christopher Lee's (Saruman's) death scene was cut from the theatrical version of The Return of the King and he had a falling out with Peter Jackson all those years ago.
Saruman first appears in The Hobbit: An Unexpected Journey. He arrives in Rivendell for a meeting of the White Council. Saruman expresses his disapproval of Gandalf's actions concerning the quest to reclaim the Lonely Mountain and dismisses Gandalf's reasons as 'looking for trouble where none exists'. He is skeptical of the information Gandalf provides on the Necromancer and he further dismisses the information when he learns it came from Radagast the Brown, who he believes is a fool and an embarrassment to the Istari due to his consumption of mushrooms. When presented with the Morgul blade, Saruman states there is no proof that it belonged to the Witch-king of Angmar. Saruman sums up all of Gandalf's concerns as nothing to worry about but states that he feels he cannot condone the quest of the Dwarves to reclaim Erebor. However, unbeknownst to Saruman, the Dwarves have already left Rivendell.
In The Hobbit: The Battle of the Five Armies, Saruman arrives at Dol Guldur along with Elrond, after being summoned there by Galadriel, to rescue Gandalf. Saruman appears as Galadriel and Gandalf are surrounded by the Nazgûl and asks if she needs assistance. At this, two of the Nazgûl turn towards him and both he and Elrond begin to battle with the Nine. Saruman duels several of the Ringwraiths, appearing to be able to handle up to two at a time. In the end, both he and Elrond overpower the Nine and they retreat momentarily. After Gandalf is taken away by Radagast, Sauron appears before the remainder of the White Council along with the returning Nazgûl. Saruman readies himself for further battle but appears to be paralyzed with awe of Sauron's power. Galadriel rises in a terrifying ethereal form and begins a battle of wills with Sauron. Saruman barely seems to notice this, still stunned in amazement of Sauron. Galadriel eventually gains the upper hand and banishes Sauron from Dol Guldur. After recovering from his shock, Saruman notes that while Galadriel has banished Sauron, it took nearly all of her power to do it and tells Elrond to take her back to Lothlórien, When Elrond argues that Sauron must be found and permanently destroyed, Saruman replies that without the One Ring, Sauron will never regain his full strength. He then tells them to go and 'leave Sauron to me.' This is most likely the point, where Saruman begins his fall into evil. Although he spoke of Sauron not regaining his full power, Saruman was clearly dumbfounded after witnessing his power first hand, foreshadowing his eventual loss of any hope of defeating him and his eventual service to Sauron.   
There is also a song called ""The Voice of Saruman"" created by the heavy metal band called ""Lorien.""

 Ralph Bakshi version 
    Saruman of Many Colours in Ralph Bakshi's version of The Lord of the Rings.  
In Ralph Bakshi's 1978 animated film of The Lord of the Rings, Fraser Kerr provided the voice of Saruman. At one point in that film's development, film executives thought that the names ""Saruman"" and ""Sauron"" were too similar, and would confuse the audience, and decided that Saruman should be renamed ""Aruman"". This decision was eventually reversed, but some references to ""Aruman"" remained in the finished film. The dialogue of Bakshi's film retained Saruman's adoption of the title ""Saruman of Many Colours"", and the character was dressed in red. In Ralph Bakshi's animated film, Saruman sends a swirling stream of magical fire from Isengard to Helm's Deep to blow apart the ramparts and walls of Helms Deep.

 Video Games 
 The Battle for Middle Earth 
    Saruman in the BFME game-series  
The evil campaign of BFME begins with Isengard's betrayal and early service to Sauron, and then continues with Saruman's conquest of Rohan signified by the fall of Helm's Deep and the deaths of Théoden and Éomer. In BFME II and its expansion ROTWK, Saruman does not take part in the campaign since BFME II shows the War in the North. While ROTWK is before Saruman's arrival in Middle Earth, in all games however, he does appear as the main hero for Isengard in skirmish battles. Saruman starts off with the standard wizard blast power which can destroy an entire battalion of infantry (Without armor upgrades)
His second ability was a fireball, very useful for blasting away heroes and flyers. His third power was called ""Wormtounge"" this ability allows Saruman to gain control of units with the power of his voice (Note: This power was temporary the units will return to their original faction after a minute or so. However if the player commands the controlled unit to attack and destroy an enemy building the unit remains in Saruman's possession)
His next power was Speechcraft. This allows friendly units to gain a major boost in experience. His final power was Lightning Blast, in which Saruman casts down a mighty lightning strike that can decimate infantry (With armor upgrades).

 The Lord of the Rings: Conquest 
In one of the early missions of the game, Isengard is attacked by the Ents and the Rohirrim soldiers and once Isengard is captured the Rohirrim and Ents are free to help reclaim Isengard for the forces of light and overthrow Saruman and his evil forces. Later in the mission, the player gets to take control of Gandalf, and is lead up through the stairs inside the tower of Orthanc to confront Saruman in a duel and the player must kill Saruman in order to be successful in the Good Campagin, the setting is the same as seen in ""The Fellowship of the Ring"", however this time Gandalf is on an equal level of power if not stronger than Saruman. Once the player succeds in killing Saruman, then the player can move on.

    Saruman charging towards the White Tree of Gondor to destroy it.  
However in the evil campaign, Sauron regains the One Ring. His power streches enough that he recalls his most potent servants (including Saruman and the Witch-king) and his allies. Later Saruman is sent with a large army to retake the frail city of Minas Tirith, Saruman is at the front line of the evil force breaking through the ranks of Gondor's soldiers as he reaches out to complete his objective of destroying (burning) the white tree and does so (fulfilling the vision Pippin had seen).
Later we see Saruman at Weathertop, where Aragorn with the aid of Gondor, the ents and the eagles making a last stand against the forces of evil, standing in the way of Rivendell and The Shire. Saruman is sent to Kill Aragorn, who stands at the peak of Weathertop waiting. Saruman succeeds in killing Aragorn and the force moves out to destroy Rivendell.
In the game, Saruman's Staff is exactly the same as the Mouth of Saurons, it could be that the Mouth of Sauron had one made similar, or that Saruman was resurrected with the staff, this however is unclear. Saruman's specialty in the game is the area attack, where he will strike the staff against the floor and punch the ground sending out two shock waves, much more powerful and causing more damage than the standard mage. His melee attack is also quick and swift, and his magic and glow of the staff is purple.

 The Lord of the Rings Online 
    Saruman in The Lord of the Rings Online  
In The Lord of the Rings Online, Saruman can be seen inside the Tower of Orthanc, both during the ""Epic Quest"" involving Isengard and the ""instances"" set inside and under the Tower, in the depths. He can also be seen once in the Dunlending village of Avardin.

 Lego: The Lord of the Rings 
In the game, Saruman is a playable character with unique abilities. Saruman's staff can levitate specific Lego objects, provide light in dark places, shoot energy bolts and conjure up a magical barrier.
He can be found atop of Orthanc in which you must use a variety of characters to ascend Orthanc. He can be purchased for 500,000 studs.

 Lego: The Hobbit

""The face of Elrond was ageless, neither old nor young, though in it was written the memory of many things both glad and sorrowful. His hair was dark as the shadows of twilight, and upon it was set a circlet of silver; his eyes were grey as a clear evening, and in them was a light like the light of stars. Venerable he seemed as a king crowned with many winters, and yet hale as a tried warrior in the fulness of his strength. He was the Lord of Rivendell and mighty among both Elves and Men.""
—The Fellowship of the Ring, ""Many Meetings""

Elrond (Sindarin; IPA: ""Star-Dome"") Half-elven, Lord of Rivendell, was one of the mighty Elf-rulers of old who lived in Middle-earth from the First Age to the beginning of the Fourth Age. He was the father of Arwen Undomiel, the eventual lover of Aragorn II Elessar.

 Biography 
 First Age 
    Maglor raising Elrond by Tuuliky  
Elrond Half-elven was the son of Eärendil and Elwing, and a great-grandson of Lúthien. He was born in the refuge of the Havens of Sirion in Beleriand late in the First Age, soon before its sack by the Sons of Fëanor. Elrond and his twin brother Elros were captured and raised by Maglor a Son of Fëanor. Though at first there was no great love between them, eventually Maglor took pity on them and cherished them, and eventually grew to love them.[4] By the end of the First Age and the War of Wrath, the Sons of Fëanor were again working alone, suggesting that by this time Elrond and Elros had left their nominal captivity and traveled to Lindon.

 Second Age 
Elrond and Elros were given the choice at the end of the First Age to be counted among Men or Elves. Elros chose the Fate of Men and became Elros Tar-Minyatur, the first King of Númenor. Elrond chose to be counted among the Elves,[5] and remained in Lindon as captain and herald of Gil-Galad, the High King of the Ñoldor.[6]
In SA 1695, Elrond was sent to Eregion by Gil-galad in an attempt to protect it from the invading forces of Sauron. Unfortunately, Elrond's host was too weak and was unable to hold off Sauron's army. He retreated north with a host of elves out of Eregion including Celeborn and remained ever watchful of Sauron from there. It was during the following two years (SA 1697) that Elrond founded Rivendell at the feet of the Misty Mountains, which survived as one of the last remaining strongholds against Sauron at the end of the Third Age.[7][8]
After the combined forces of the elves under Gil-galad, Cirdan, Elrond and the Men of Númenor defeated Sauron in SA 1701 Elrond remained in Rivendell and hosted the first White Council, attended by Galadriel, at which it was decided that Elrond's home, the Last Homely House, would remain the last stronghold west of the Misty Mountains, and that the Three Rings then held by Gil-galad and Galadriel would remain hidden. According to one account Gil-galad at this time gave Elrond Vilya the Blue Ring, though in other accounts Gil-Galad kept both Narya and Vilya until the end of the Second Age. It was also here that Elrond first met Celebrían, the daughter of Celeborn and Galadriel.

    Elrond in battle during the War of the Last Alliance in the Second Age  
Near the end of the Second Age, Elrond rode beside Gil-galad in the Last Alliance of Elves and Men, which set out from Rivendell to Mordor in SA 3431. Elrond was Gil-galad's herald during the war against Sauron. The Alliance, which also included elves from Lorien, men from Arnor and Gondor, and Dwarves led by Durin lV, eventually defeated Sauron's army and laid siege to Barad-dûr for seven years. Eventually, Sauron himself was defeated by Elendil and Gil-galad, allowing Isildur to cut the One Ring from Sauron's finger and claim the Ring for himself.
The war took a toll on the forces of both Elves and Men. Gil-galad, Elendil, and his younger son Anarion were killed in the siege. Elrond and Cirdan only remained as the commanders of the elves, and Isildur as lord of men. Upon discovering that Isildur had claimed the One Ring for himself Elrond urged Isildur to throw the Ring into the fires of Mount Doom, but the seduction of the ring made Isildur refuse. Isildur claimed the Ring as a Weregild for his father and brother, and Elrond (perhaps not fully understanding the nature of the One Ring) acknowledged his claim. Isildur was then named High King of Gondor and Arnor and took his father's throne, while Elrond returned to Rivendell at the end of the war.[7]

 Third Age 
    Elrond in Rivendell at the time of the Quest of Erebor  
In the year TA 109, Elrond wedded Celebrían. In the year TA 130, the twins Elladan and Elrohir were born, and in TA 241 a daughter, Arwen Undómiel. Elrond lost Celebrían in TA 2510 when she was waylaid by orcs crossing the Misty Mountains and, unable to recover, took a ship to the Undying Lands.[9][10]
In the later years, he was instrumental in harboring the heirs of Isildur while the line lasted, the most famous of these sons of men was Aragorn son of Arathorn II, whom he took in and fostered as his own after his father died in TA 2933. Elrond, foreseeing the boy's difficult future gave him the name Estel, Sindarin for Hope. Aragorn grew up in Imladris unaware of his kingly lineage until Elrond told him when he had reached his manhood.[11]
He also was a member of the White Council, which was often held in Rivendell, and was a great friend of Gandalf the Grey. He helped Thorin Oakenshield's expedition to retake the Lonely Mountain by discovering and translating the Moon Writing on Thorin's map.[12]
After Frodo's departure from the Shire with the One Ring, Elrond sent out riders to help guide him back to Rivendell. One of these, Glorfindel, successfully found Frodo and helped him reach Rivendell.[13] On October 25, 3018 he held the Council at which it was decided to attempt to destroy the One Ring. He appeared to have selected the members of the Fellowship other than Frodo and Sam.[14]
Later, Elrond sent his sons Elladan and Elrohir with the Rangers of the North to Rohan. Through his sons, Elrond advised Aragorn to take the Paths of the Dead.[15]

    Elrond departs Middle-earth  
Elrond remained in Rivendell until the destruction of the One Ring and of Sauron, after which he went to Minas Tirith to surrender the Sceptre of Annúminas to King Elessar and give his daughter Arwen Undómiel away to be married.[16] On September 29, 3021, Elrond left Middle-earth to go over the sea with the other Ring-bearers, never to return.[17]

 Etymology 
Elrond is a Sindarin name that means ""Star-dome"" or ""Elf of the cave"", from el (""Elf"" or ""star"", interchangeably) and rond (""cave, vault"").[18][19][20]

 Character 
Elrond was a skillful warrior in battle and had commanded various armies of the Free Peoples well, including the Last Alliance. He was just as effective at leadership and gave much wise counsel. He had the gift of foresight through which he could view lands and events far away from Rivendell. He was also adept at healing others, though whether through medical knowledge or magic isn't known. The latter may be more probable in that Elrond managed to cure a Morgul wound, something which is almost invariably fatal due to its association with dark sorcery. While it is unknown just how powerful Elrond is compared to other Elf Lords, he certainly holds vast potential, being descended from the angelic Maia Melian and being the wielder of the ring of power Vilya. A notable demonstration includes Elrond summoning a great flood on the River Bruinen to sweep away the Nazgûl. Elrond was also familiar with ósanwe, the skill of entering others' minds. After the destruction of the One Ring Elrond communicated mentally with Galadriel and Gandalf on their return journey from Minas Tirith.[21]
Elrond was one of the most incorruptible of leaders of Middle-earth. Aragorn speculated that among the few capable of completely resisting Saruman's power of speech were Elrond, Galadriel, and Gandalf. Elrond also rejected and opposed Sauron when the latter offered partnership with the Elves.

""This is Nenya, the Ring of Adamant, and I am its keeper.""
—Galadriel to Frodo Baggins

Galadriel was the ""Lady"" of the woods of Lothlórien, which she ruled with Celeborn her husband.
She was one of the greatest of the Elves in Middle-earth, surpassing nearly all others in beauty, knowledge, and power. She bore Nenya, one of the three Elven rings of power. J.R.R. Tolkien thought of her, along with Gil-galad the Elven-king, as one of the mightiest and fairest of all the Elves left in Middle-earth in the Third Age.
She was the only daughter and youngest child of Finarfin, prince of the Ñoldor and of Eärwen, whose cousin was Lúthien. Her elder brothers were Finrod Felagund, Orodreth, Angrod, and Aegnor.[3] Galadriel was a niece of Fëanor, the most important Elf of the early First Age.

Biography
Years of the Trees
    Galadriel in Aman, by Filat  
Galadriel was born in Valinor during the Years of the Trees before the First Age had even begun. Much of Galadriel's story is confusing, and there are several distinct tales told about her collected in the Unfinished Tales. According to the older account, used in the published Silmarillion, Galadriel was an eager participant and leader in the rebellion of the Ñoldor and their flight from Valinor due to her desire to one day rule over a patch of Middle-earth herself.
She was eager to see Middle-earth, having heard of it from Fëanor, and wanted to rule a realm of her own. She swore no oaths and was like minded with her cousin Fingon, son of Fingolfin.[4]
However, separated from Fëanor and his kin, she and her people did not take part in the Kinslaying at Alqualondë. They followed Fingolfin instead and crossed the Helcaraxë in the far north.[4]

First Age
Once in Beleriand, she lived nominally with one of her brothers, most likely Finrod, but spent much time at the court of Thingol and Melian in Menegroth, where she arrived in FA 52 and was welcomed because of her family relationship to Thingol's brother Olwë, Galadriel's maternal grandfather. She met Celeborn, a kinsman of Thingol, in Doriath.[5] She also traveled to visit her brother, Finrod, in his realm of Nargothrond multiple times. Her three other brothers were killed during various battles in the First Age.
Galadriel became friends with Melian the Maia, who wanted to know the cause of the exile of the Ñoldor. Galadriel only briefly narrated the story to her, leaving out the death of Finwë, the Kinslaying at Alqualondë, and the burning of the ships at Losgar. She dwelt in Nargothrond with her brother Finrod, and asked him if he would take no wife. But Finrod had taken an oath only for himself, and his beloved had been left in Valinor.[6]
She had no role in the major wars of the First Age, believing that defeating Morgoth was beyond the power of the Eldar; when Morgoth was defeated by the coming of the Valar out of the West she, having played no part in the earlier Kinslaying, was offered safe return to Valinor. However, she chose not to leave Middle-earth, and was the only leader of the Ñoldor exiles to remain after the First Age.[7]

 Second Age 
Celeborn and Galadriel traveled first to Lindon, where they ruled over a group of Elves as a fiefdom under Gil-galad. Sometime later, they had a daughter, Celebrían. They moved eastward and established the realm of Eregion, or Hollin, which they ruled under Gil-galad, the High King of the Ñoldor. Eregion, to the west of the Misty Mountains near Moria, was a prosperous kingdom during this time, and had open trade with the Dwarves. Also, during this time, they made contact with a Nandorin settlement in the valley of the Anduin, later to be known as Lothlórien. Subsequently, while Celebrimbor now ruled over Eregion, they left Eregion by way of the mines of Khazad-dûm. After the death of the current King Amdír, in the War of the Last Alliance, and the departure his son on Amroth, Celeborn and Galadriel became the Lord and Lady of Lothlórien.

    Galadriel, Gil-galad, and Cirdan receive the Three Rings of Power.  
During the Second Age, the Maia Annatar, the ""Lord of Gifts"", guided Celebrimbor and the other Ñoldor of Eregion in the creation of the Rings of Power. Galadriel took an immediate distrust to Annatar, and it later turned out that this mistrust was justified, as he was finally revealed to be Sauron. It was she who counseled Celebrimbor in the hiding of the rings, and when Eregion was attacked, Galadriel was entrusted with one of the Three Rings of the Elves. Her ring was Nenya, the Ring of Water.
Conscious of Sauron's power, and wishing to thwart it, she did not openly use the powers of her ring as long as the One Ring was in Sauron's hands. However, during the Third Age, when the One Ring was lost, she put it to good use protecting the borders of her realm, for the powers of her ring were protection, preservation, and concealment from evil.[8]

 Third Age 
Through Celebrían's wedding to Elrond, Galadriel was the grandmother of Elladan, Elrohir, and Arwen.
The tales tell little of Galadriel or of Celeborn during many centuries in the Third Age, but after the formation of the White Council in TA 2463 she put forth her might in opposition of Sauron. During the invasion of the Balchoth, Galadriel provided aid to Eorl the Young and the Éothéod in the form of a white mist that protected them both from the evils of Sauron in Dol Guldur and the sight of their enemies. This allowed the Eotheod to ride unnoticed to the Battle of the Field of Celebrant. They would become the Rohirrim but regarded her and the Golden Wood with fear.
She played a pivotal role in the formation of the Council, though her counsel to put Gandalf at its head was not followed.[8] After Sauron was ousted from his fortress of Dol Guldur, Lórien kept vigilance over the region until the time of the War of the Ring.

 War of the Ring 
    Galadriel pours water into her Mirror.  
During the War of the Ring, Galadriel hosted the Fellowship of the Ring after their escape from the mines of Moria.
Once in Caras Galadhon, Galadriel allowed Frodo and Sam to peer into the Mirror of Galadriel, enabling them to glimpse possible events of the future. She, in turn, was tested when Frodo Baggins later offered to place the One Ring in her keeping. To illustrate what would happen if she accepted, she presented an image of herself corrupted by the ring, declaring:In place of the Dark Lord you will set up a Queen. And I shall not be dark, but beautiful and terrible as the Morning and the Night! Fair as the Sea and the Sun and the Snow upon the Mountain! Dreadful as the Storm and the Lightning! Stronger than the foundations of the earth. All shall love me and despair!"" In the movie, what she says is different, which is: ""In place of a Dark Lord, you would have a queen! Not dark, but beautiful and terrible as the dawn! Treacherous as the sea! Stronger than the foundations of the earth! All shall love me, and despair!Then swiftly she returned to her original form, seemingly smaller and frailer than before, declaring, ""I pass the test,"" refusing the Ring and accepting the fate of diminishing (as the time of the Dominion of Men had come), and returning at last to Valinor. As the Fellowship departed, she gave each member a gift and an Elven cloak, and outfitted the party with boats and supplies. Gimli, in particular, was touched by Galadriel's lordliness and beauty, and asks for one strand of her golden hair as an heirloom of his house; she generously gave him three, which he later set in an impregnable crystal.
Apart from the strands of hair given to Gimli, she gave a Mallorn seed and a small box of earth from her garden to Samwise Gamgee; a green stone set in silver to Aragorn, along with a scabbard for his sword; and a belt each to Boromir, Merry, and Pippin. To Legolas she gave a long, stout bow of the Galadhrim. To Frodo ,she gave a magical phial which captured the light of Eärendil's star, without which Frodo and Sam would have been unable to pass through Shelob's lair to complete their quest. After the departure of the Fellowship, Galadriel acted to ensure the success of the quest. It was she who summoned Gwaihir to rescue Gandalf off the peak of Celebdil, and it was she who nursed him back to health, dressing him in white, symbolizing his status as the new leader of the order. 
Later, she sent word to Aragorn about the Paths of the Dead, and messages to the Rangers of the North asking for their aid in the War. As Sauron put forth all his power during the end of the War of the Ring, he was aware of the threat of the Elves and their ancient potency, so he sent armies to besiege many of their settlements in the North while simultaneously assailing the major cities of Men and Dwarves. Lórien itself was assaulted three times, but the armies of Dol Guldur were driven back due to the courage of the Elves and the power of Galadriel's Ring.

    Galadriel, her husband Celeborn, and Elrond about to leave for Valinor  
It is said that the power of her Ring could not be overcome unless Sauron himself would come to do battle. After the fall of Sauron she, with Thranduil of Mirkwood and their elven allies, crossed the Anduin into Dol Guldur, where they tore down its walls and laid bare its pits. She then traveled to Minas Tirith for the wedding of King Aragorn and Lady Arwen and continued living in Lórien until TA 3021 when she traveled to the Grey Havens and, with the remaining Ring-bearers, took a ship and returned at last to the Undying Lands whence she had come so long ago.[9]

 Character 
    Galadriel shows her mirror to Frodo and Sam  
The Lady Galadriel - ""Lady of Light"" - grandmother of Lady Arwen, was an Elven Queen of extraordinary beauty, with her timeless features and golden river of hair.
Galadriel was highly praised for her beauty, particularly that of her hair, which was a deep and radiant gold, shot with silver. It was said by the elves of Tirion to have ensnared the light of the two trees, Telperion and Laurelin, and possibly to have inspired the creation of the Silmarils by Fëanor. She was also the tallest of elf-women, standing at around 6 feet 4 inches, or 193 centimeters. Because of her wisdom and power, she had very important roles throughout the history of Middle-earth, especially during her time in Eregion and during the War of the Ring. She had a penchant for dressing in the purest white.She was known, especially in her younger days, as being quite prideful. However, by the end of the Third Age, that pride had been tempered a great deal by age.
[...] and she grew to be tall beyond the measure even of the women of the Noldor; she was strong of body, mind, and will [...] Even among the Eldar she was accounted beautiful, and her hair was held a marvel unmatched. It was golden like the hair of her father and of her foremother Indis, but richer and more radiant, for its gold was touched by some memory of the starlike silver of her mother; and the Eldar said that the light of the Two Trees, Laurelin and Telperion, had been snared in her tresses.

Vanyar (House of Finwë)



Indis was a Vanyar Elf of Valinor.
She was the niece of Ingwë, the King of the Vanyar and High King of the Elves, for her mother was Ingwë's sister.[2] Indis was known for her great beauty and was thus referred to as Indis the Fair.[1]

Contents[show]
 Biography 
In YT 1185 [3], Indis married Finwë, the High King of the Ñoldor and was his second wife after the death of Míriel Serindë. She bore two sons, Fingolfin and Finarfin, and two daughters, Findis and Irimë. Through Finwë's first marriage, she was the stepmother to Fëanor, his first and only son to Míriel.[4]
Unfortunately, Fëanor harbored very little love for her or her sons which probably contributed to his mistrust of Fingolfin when Melkor began spreading his poisonous lies amongst the Ñoldor.[5]
After the death of Finwë and the rebellion of the Ñoldor, Indis and her eldest daughter Findis returned to their people of the Vanyar and dwelt there until Manwë restored Finwë to life. Their second daughter Irimë, however, went into exile with her brother Fingolfin.[6]

 Descendants 
Through her elder son Fingolfin, Indis was the grandmother of Turgon, his second son; and thus she was the great-great-great grandmother of Elrond and Elros, and through Elros, the line of the Dunedain.
Through her younger son Finarfin, Indis was the grandmother of his only daughter the great Lady Galadriel of Lothlórien, thus adjoining Indis to Galadriel's daughter Celebrian as her great grandmother and once more to Celebrian's children, Elladan, Elrohir, and Arwen Undómiel, as their great-great grandmother. Also, in being connected to Arwen in this way, Indis was also distantly related to the Kings of Gondor, as Arwen married King Elessar of Gondor, and produced the heir to the throne, Eldarion.

Eldarion (Quenya: IPA; ""Son of the Eldar"") was the only son of Aragorn II Elessar and Arwen Undómiel, King and Queen of the Reunited Kingdoms of Gondor and Arnor in Middle-earth.

Contents[show]
 Biography 
Eldarion was born on an unspecified date, and is recorded to have several sisters. He ascended to the throne upon the death of his father in FO 120. Next to nothing is known of his rule, except that he probably maintained the peace and the borders of the Reunited Kingdom as set down by his father after the War of the Ring.[1]

 Lineage 
Through his father, Aragorn II Elessar, he is a direct descendant of Elendil, the grandson of Arathorn II and Gilraen, great-grandson of Arador and great-great grandson of Argonui; both from Dúnedain of the North.
Through his mother, Arwen Undómiel, he was the grandson of Lord Elrond and Lady Celebrian, nephew of Elladan and Elrohir of Rivendell, grandnephew of Elros Tar-Minyatur, great-grandson of Lady Galadriel and Lord Celeborn of Lothlorien, great grandson of Eärendil and Elwing.

 Etymology 
Eldarion is Quenya for ""Son of the Eldar"", from elda (""high-elf) and -ion (a patronymic ending, ""son of, descendant"").[2]

 Behind the scenes 
J.R.R. Tolkien had vague plans for a sequel to the Lord of the Rings trilogy called The New Shadow, a story set sometime during King Eldarion's reign. However, he abandoned it after about 13 pages. Therefore, it is debatable whether The New Shadow can be considered canon.

Elwing, also known as Elwing the White, was the daughter of Dior the Fair and his wife Nimloth. She was the younger sister of the twin brothers Eluréd and Elurín. She became the wife of Eärendil the Mariner, and was the mother of Elrond and Elros.

Contents[show]
 Biography 
Elwing, as well as her brothers, were born in a house near Lanthir Lamath and lived there until her father went to Doriath to assume his inheritance as King of Doriath.[2]
When the Sons of Fëanor attacked Doriath, all of her immediate family was either killed or lost, but those loyal to her family took Elwing as well as the Silmaril they sought and bore her away to the Havens of Sirion.[2]
It was at the Havens that Elwing met Eärendil and later married him. She bore him twin sons, Elrond and Elros. Elrond later went on to marry Lady Celebrian, daughter of Lord Celeborn and Lady Galadriel of Lothlórien. From this marriage they produced three children, Elladan and Elrohir, twin brothers, and Arwen Undómiel, future Queen of Gondor. These children were therefore Elwing's grandchildren, a privilege shared with the Lord and Lady of Lothlórien. In the present matter at hand, Elwing was forced to abandon her children when the Sons of Fëanor came for the Silmaril in Elwing's possession. Rather than give it over, she threw herself into the Sea and was transformed into a great white bird.[3]
She flew continuously until she found her husband's sailing ship, the Vingilot. Then, on behalf of the Elves and Men of Middle-earth, they chose to sail for Valinor in the faint hope that they could make a final plea on behalf of those who suffered under Morgoth.[3]
When they arrived, Elwing chose to accompany her husband onto the shores, even though she knew it might mean her death. While Eärendil journeyed to visit the Valar, Elwing walked the shores, eventually meeting the Elves of Alqualondë. There, she told them the tale of what was happening in Middle-earth and became much loved by them.[3]
The Valar eventually agreed to go to war to aid those in Middle-earth, and also decided to give both Eärendil and Elwing the choice of which kindred they would belong. Eärendil, out of respect for his wife, allowed her to choose for the both of them. She chose to be counted among the elves, in honor of her foremother, Lúthien.[3]
A white tower was later built for Elwing where she could live. It was also said that the birds taught her their language and that she would fly to meet Eärendil when he returned from his nightly voyages.[3]

 Etymology 
The name Elwing means ""Star-foam"", from the Sindarin el (""star"") and wing (""foam, spray"").[4]

""Shall I always be left behind when the Riders depart, to mind the house while they win renown, and find food and beds when they return?""
—Éowyn, to Aragorn[5]

Éowyn was a shieldmaiden of Rohan, daughter of Éomund and Theodwyn, younger sister of Éomer and niece of King Théoden. After the War of the Ring, she married Faramir and had one son with him, Elboron.

Contents[show]
 Biography 
    Young Éomer and Éowyn, by Anna Lee  
Éowyn was the second child of Éomund and Theodwyn. Like her brother Éomer, she was related to King Théoden through their mother, the King's sister. Her father was slain and her mother died of illness in TA 3002. Afterwards, Théoden took Éomer and Éowyn in his household and raised them as his children.

 War of the Ring 
During the War of the Ring, Éowyn was forced to stay in Meduseld and care for her declining uncle for several years, as he was weakened by the influence of Saruman and Gríma Wormtongue. When Gandalf restored the King, he prepared to defend Rohan against Isengard. Since Théoden planned to ride to battle himself, he asked his doorwarden Háma, to suggest a leader for the people in his absence. Háma recommended Éowyn, who, though a woman, was ""fearless"" and ""all love[d] her"".
Éowyn reluctantly obeyed the King's orders to stay behind in Edoras while Aragorn, Théoden, and the rest of the men confronted Saruman's army at the Battle of the Hornburg. When they returned, victorious to Edoras, Éowyn had kept everything in perfect order for their return. It was near this time when she confessed her growing feelings for Aragorn, but he reluctantly refused.
When Denethor II urgently called for Théoden's aid against Mordor, Éowyn again, begged to be allowed to ride with Aragorn to battle, but he refused.
In bitterness, she disguised herself as a man, under the alias Dernhelm, and rode to Minas Tirith on her horse Windfola. She took Meriadoc Brandybuck along because he likewise wanted to follow his friends to battle, but had been refused by Théoden. Because Éowyn weighed less than a man of similar height, Windfola was able to bear both her and Merry.[1]

    Eowyn fighting the Witch King, by moonxels  
During the Battle of the Pelennor Fields, she fought in Théoden's escort; when he and his company were attacked by the Witch-king of Angmar, lord of the Nazgûl, she and Merry were the only riders who did not flee. As Théoden lay mortally wounded, she challenged the Witch-King, who boasted that ""no living man may hinder me"". In answer, she removed her helmet, exposing her long blond hair, and declared, ""No living man am I! You look upon a woman! Éowyn I am, Éomund's daughter. Begone if you be not deathless! For living or dark undead, I will smite you, if you touch him!"".[3]
In a rage, the Witch-king attacked her, but she cleaved the head off his Fell Beast. The Witch-king shattered her shield with a blow of his mace, breaking her arm, but stumbled when Merry stabbed his leg from behind with a Barrow-blade of Westernesse make. Éowyn stabbed her sword through the Witch-king's head, killing him,[3] and thus fulfilling Glorfindel's prophecy a thousand years earlier at the Battle of Fornost that ""not by the hand of man"" would the Witch-king fall.[6]

    Éowyn at the Houses of Healing  
Her constitution already severely weakened by her loneliness and despair, combined with her physical injuries, Éowyn succumbed to a severe case of the Black Breath. Théoden, not knowing that she was nearby, told Merry with his dying words that she had been ""dearer than daughter"" to him.
Seeing her lying apparently dead on the battlefield caused her brother Éomer to go temporarily mad, and charge in fury at the enemy. But during the battle she was found by Prince Imrahil, who noticed that she was still alive, though barely, and ordered her taken to the Houses of Healing. There she was healed by Aragorn, the cure of the plant Athelas, and the entreaties of her distraught brother.[7]

    Éowyn and Faramir  
Éowyn remained behind in Minas Tirith while the Army of the West marched toward Morannon, the Black Gate, to challenge Sauron. She met and fell in love with Faramir, who had likewise been injured before the battle. After the War of the Ring had ended, she decided to give up dreams of glory in battle and devote her life to peace and a happy marriage.[7]

 Later years 
At Éowyn's insistence, Merry was made a Knight of the Riddermark. He attended Théoden's funeral and Éomer's coronation as King of Rohan, where Éowyn presented Merry with a parting gift: the Horn of Rohan, a small silver horn taken from the hoard of Scatha, the dragon.
Faramir and Éowyn settled in Ithilien, where they had at least one son (likely Elboron), and their grandson was Barahir, who wrote The Tale of Aragorn and Arwen in the Fourth Age. The date of Éowyn's death is nowhere recorded.

 Etymology 
Éowyn means ""horse lover"" in Anglo-Saxon (the language Tolkien used to represent Rohirric).
The name was derived from an old Welsh name, Øwyn - slightly altered to sound like ""A-O-win"". The name in Welsh means ""Horse friend"", with the prefix Éo- meaning 'horse' and the suffix -wyn (""whün"") meaning 'friend.'

 Pronunciation 
The first syllable of Éowyn's name is pronounced ""eh-ah,"" with the ""ah"" just barely pronounced. The second syllable pronounced is slightly different than it looks, however, being in Welsh it is pronounced ""een;"" the sound it makes together in an ""Eh-awe-een,"" having the ""w"" barely pronounced at all, instead the word creates its own soft ""w"" without the voluntary sound, as in Welsh ""w"" is considered to be a vowel. As in Scandinavian, the ""y"" in the second syllable is the same sound as the German letter ""ü"" or the French ""u"".

 Titles 
Éowyn's title was ""Lady of Rohan"" and was also known as ""The White Lady of Rohan"" due to her pale complexion. She also used the alias ""Dernhelm"" while riding with Rohan's army, and after her wounding by the Witch-king in the Pelennor Fields as ""Lady of the Shield-arm"".[3] After her marriage to Faramir she was called the Lady of Ithilien (in contrast to Faramir, who was styled Prince of Ithilien), and Lady of Emyn Arnen.

 Biography 
 Earlier Years 
Théoden was the only son of Thengel, and became king after the death of his father in TA 2980. Théoden spoke Sindarin and Westron more often than Rohirric, due to the influence of his father, and spent a part of his youth growing up in the mountain vales of Gondor, his mother's homeland.[2]
His sister Théodwyn lived with him in Edoras, and after she and her husband both died he adopted her children Éomer and Éowyn as his own. He had a son Théodred, whose mother Elfhild died in childbirth.[2]

 War of the Ring 
    Grima and Théoden, under a spell, in the Golden Hall of Meduseld  
By the time of the War of the Ring, Théoden had been king for nearly 40 years, and was becoming old and tired. He was increasingly misled by his chief adviser Gríma (or Wormtongue as most others in the Mark called him), who was secretly in the employ of Saruman the White. Gríma may even have been poisoning Théoden. In the last years before the War of the Ring, Théoden let his rule slip out of his hands, and Gríma gained an increasingly large hold over him. Rohan was troubled again by Orcs and Dunlendings as well as the new fighting Uruk-hai, who operated under the will of Saruman, ruling from Isengard.[3]
When Théoden's son Théodred was mortally wounded at a battle at the Fords of Isen in skirmish with the Orcs of Saruman, his nephew Éomer became his heir. Éomer fell out of favor with Wormtongue and was eventually banished from Rohan.

    Théoden upon reclaiming his sword, Herugrim  
When Gandalf the White, Aragorn, Legolas and Gimli appeared before him, Théoden initially rebuked Gandalf's advice to resist Saruman, but after being released from the effects of Gríma, he commanded Háma to release his nephew and bring him his sword. Théoden, under advice from Gandalf, retreated from the impending approach of Saruman's army to the fortress of the Hornburg, and shortly thereafter successfully defended the keep at the Battle of the Hornburg despite overwhelming odds. After this, he became known as Théoden Ednew, the Renewed, because he had thrown off the yoke of Saruman.
Following the battle, Théoden came with Gandalf to the ruins of Isengard, where he met Meriadoc Brandybuck and Peregrin Took. He soon made a favorite of Merry, and expressed great interest in hearing more about the Shire, especially Hobbit lore surrounding pipe-weed. 
Théoden led the Rohirrim to the aid of Gondor at the Battle of the Pelennor Fields bravely charging the legions of Sauron, where he won great glory by defeating a chieftain of the Southrons bearing the banner of the Black Serpent in single combat.[5]


""Fey he seemed, or the battle-fury of his fathers ran like new fire in his veins, and he was borne up on Snowmane like a king of old""
—Tolkien's description of Théoden charging the orcs

    King Théoden dies  
He challenged the Witch-king of the Nine Ringwraiths, and was unconscious when his horse Snowmane fell upon him after being spooked by the Ringwraith's fell beast. He was quickly protected by Éowyn and Merry, both of whom had ridden to war in secret.[5]
Theoden's wounds were mortal and he perished on the plains of Pelennor. His body was preserved in the Hallows of Minas Tirith until Eomer returned to Rohan, and Theoden was buried in Edoras.[6]
After his death, a Rohirrim minstrel Gléowine composed a song for him and the other Kings of Rohan.[6]


Out of doubt, out of dark, to the day's rising
he rode singing in the sun, sword unsheathing.
Hope he rekindled, and in hope he ended;
over death, over dread, over doom lifted
out of loss, out of life, unto long glory.


 Etymology 
The name Théoden is taken from the Anglo-Saxon word þeoden, meaning ""lord"". It is related to the Old Norse word þjóðann, meaning ""leader of the people"" (i.e. ""King"").
It might have been translated from the original Rohirric Tûrac, an old word for ""king"".[7]

""But, but, lord, I offered you my sword. I do not want to be parted from you like this, Théoden King. And as all my friends have gone to the battle, I should be ashamed to stay behind.""
—Merry addressing King Théoden

Meriadoc ""Merry"" Brandybuck (later known as Meriadoc ""Merry"" Brandybuck I, due to his grandson's birth) was a Hobbit and one of Frodo's cousins and closest friends. He loved boats and ponies and had a great interest in the maps of Middle-earth. He was also one of the nine companions of the Fellowship of the Ring, and later became the eighth Master of Buckland.

Contents[show]
 Biography 
Merry was born in TA 2982. He was the only child of Saradoc Brandybuck (TA 2940 - FO 11) the Master of Buckland, and Esmeralda Took (TA 2936 - ?), the younger sister of Paladin Took II. This made him first cousin to Paladin's son Pippin, who was also his closest friend.

 War of the Ring 
Merry was often considered the most perceptive and intelligent of the hobbits, for example, knowing of the One Ring and its power even before Frodo Baggins left the Shire. He guarded Bag End after Bilbo's party, protecting Frodo from the various and often unwanted guests. He also was the force behind ""the Conspiracy"" of Sam, Pippin, Fredegar Bolger (more commonly known as ""Fatty"", due to his plump form) and himself to help Frodo. Thus, even before the Quest of the Ring begins, Merry was well prepared and organized; he assembled their gear and brought ponies. His shortcut through the Old Forest served them well, because they avoided the Black Riders and met Tom Bombadil, who helped them. At the Barrow-downs, Merry acquired his sword, a work of Westernesse.

    Merry with his good friend Pippin  
At Bree, he was not present in the Prancing Pony when Frodo foolishly put on the ring; but was outside taking a walk, and was nearly killed by the Nazgûl who arrived. At Rivendell, he was seen studying maps and plotting their path. His approval to the Fellowship came with only a little less reluctance than Pippin's; they were the two to relay news to the people of the Shire about Frodo's journey, but in the end Gandalf, believing in the friendship and loyalty shown to Frodo and Sam, requested that Elrond allow the two hobbits to come along. At Amon Hen he was captured along with Pippin by a band of Saruman's fighting Uruk-hai, but he made a good account for himself, and Boromir valiantly defended him, though Boromir died in the attempt.
After being captured by the Uruks, Ugluk crudely tried to bandage Merry's head wound. Despite this, a scar would remain on Merry's head forever. The Uruks then gave to them an Orc Drink, which would keep the hobbits at a faster pace towards Isengard. When they neared Fangorn Forest, Grishnákh began searching them, attempting to find the One Ring, which he believes they carry. Before he is able to escape with the hobbits, Éomer's Éored attacked and all of the orcs, including Grishnákh, are slain. During the confusion of the battle Merry and Pippin were able to escape into Fangorn Forest.
Escaping with Pippin into Fangorn Forest, Treebeard and the newly risen Gandalf the White met him. Along with Pippin, he drank significant amounts of Entwash, which contributed to speedy gains in height and hair growth. Accompanying Treebeard to the Entmoot, and later to Isengard, he and Pippin were set as guardians following Saruman's fall. It was here that Merry encountered King Théoden of Rohan, and was reunited with the remaining members of the Fellowship (save Frodo and Sam).
Separated from Pippin when Gandalf took the latter to Gondor, Merry swore fealty to Théoden and became his squire. Without permission from his liege, he rode to the Battle of the Pelennor Fields in the care of young Dernhelm (who was actually Éowyn, though Merry didn't know it). When Nazgûl attacked the Riders of Rohan and Théoden was injured, Merry and Éowyn faced the Witch-king of Angmar alone. Here, Merry's companion revealed herself to be Éowyn. Battling both fell beast and the Nazgûl alone, Éowyn was well assisted by Merry's crucial move: his sword, built for this very purpose, was one of the few weapons able to pierce the Ringwraith's form, but at a great expense to himself. He cut the Witch-king behind the knee as he was about to kill Eowyn. This was enough to allow Éowyn to finish off the Witch-king. Merry heard Théoden's last words, but went unnoticed by the honor escort of Riders and was found wandering the city by Pippin. He was saved by the healing of Aragorn and recovered fully.

For his bravery in battle, King Éomer, as the new King of Rohan, knighted him and gave him the name of ""Holdwine"". During the Scouring of the Shire, he was in the forefront of the Battle of Bywater, using the Horn of Rohan presented to him by Éowyn.[1]     
 Later life 
Upon their return he and Pippin both married beautiful hobbit women. They were also the tallest of hobbits - Meriadoc being the slightly taller of the two - taller even than the legendary Bandobras ""Bullroarer"" Took, due to their having drunk large amounts of Entwater. Merry married Estella Bolger some time after the end of the Third Age. He became the Master of Buckland in SR 1432 (FA 11). He wrote Old Words and Names in the Shire. Although he was not recorded as having any children within the family trees, he clearly had at least one son. At the age of 102, Merry returned to Rohan and Gondor with Pippin, dying there some time after the year FO 63. He was laid to rest in Gondor, and when Elessar died in FO 120, he and Pippin were entombed beside the great king.[2]

Isildur was the oldest son of Elendil and brother to Anárion. As the High King of Gondor and Arnor, Isildur and his brother Anárion jointly ruled Gondor in the South, while their father dwelt in the North.
During the War of the Last Alliance, Isildur cut the One Ring from Sauron's hand, but he refused to destroy it. Isildur was later killed by Orcs and the Ring was lost in the Disaster of the Gladden Fields for nearly 2,500 years. His refusal to destroy the Ring allowed Sauron's spirit to endure and ensured that he would remain a threat to Middle-earth for years to come. Isildur's bloodline survived in the Dúnedain of the North and his heirs would help end Sauron's power in the War of the Ring.

Contents[show]
 Biography 
 Life in Númenor 
Isildur was born in Númenor in the year SA 3209 of the Second Age.[1] He had a younger brother Anárion in SA 3219. They lived at the haven of Rómenna on the east coast of the island of Númenor. Their father was Elendil and their grandfather was Amandil, the Lord of Andúnië. The Lords of Andúnië were descended from the Kings of Númenor through Silmarien, the daughter of the fourth King of Númenor, Tar-Elendil.[2]
Elros, the Half-elven and the first King of Númenor, had chosen the life of Men, while his brother Elrond chose the life of Elves. Over time, the Kings of Númenor grew to resent their ancestor's choice and desired power for themselves. They became estranged from the Elves and from the powers called the Valar and they neglected the worship of Eru, the one who had created them.
A small group of Númenóreans remained friendly with the elves and faithful to Eru and the Valar. They were called the Faithful. Among these men were the Lords of Andúnië.
In SA 3262, Ar-Pharazon, the King of Númenor, took Sauron captive and brought him to Númenor. Sauron allowed himself to be taken because he wanted to corrupt the Númenóreans in order to bring about their downfall. He used their desire for immortality and power to convince them to renounce Eru and worship Morgoth.
Isildur learned that Sauron wanted Ar-Pharazon to cut down Nimloth, the White Tree that had come from the Undying Lands. Isildur disguised himself and went secretly to the King's Court and took a fruit from Nimloth. The guards discovered and attacked him and, although receiving grave injuries, he managed to escape with the fruit. For this deed, Isildur received much praise. He stood near death for many months, but when the fruit of the White Tree began to sprout, he awoke and was recovered from his injuries.[2]
As Sauron's influence increased, the Faithful began to prepare to leave Númenor. They filled their ships with their families and many of their prized possessions, including the Palantíri. Isildur had three ships of his own, and he brought aboard the seedling of the White Tree as well as his wife and his son Elendur, who had been born in SA 3299.[1]
Isildur's grandfather Amandil hoped to plead with the Valar to spare the Faithful. He sailed westward toward the Undying Lands, but what became of him is not known and he was never seen again.
As Ar-Pharazon felt the approach of old age, Sauron's lies finally convinced him he could achieve life in the Undying Lands. In SA 3319,[3] Ar-Pharazon set out with a great fleet intending to take the Undying Lands by force, but when he set foot on the shore, Ilúvatar caused the Seas to open up and Valinor was hidden. The fleet sank and Númenor was destroyed by a great wave.[2]

 Life in Middle-earth 
The ships of the Faithful were spared, and a great wind from the west sent them to the shores of Middle-earth. Elendil landed in the north, while Isildur and Anárion came to the Mouths of the Anduin in the south. Elendil and his sons established the North-kingdom of Arnor and the South-kingdom of Gondor in SA 3320. Elendil was the High King of both realms, but he ruled from Arnor and committed the rule of Gondor to his sons.[4]
Isildur lived in Minas Ithil on the eastern side of the Anduin, while Anárion made his home in Minas Anor on the western side of the Anduin. Isildur built Minas Ithil in a valley of the Mountains of Shadow on the border of Mordor. Minas Ithil was a beautiful city, but it was also a stronghold to defend against the evil that might still dwell in Mordor. It was not known at first that Sauron had already returned there in secret and had begun to rebuild his strength.
Isildur had one of the Palantír called the Ithil-stone, which he used to communicate with his brother and father. He planted the seedling of the White Tree in front of his house. Isildur and his wife had two more sons while living in Gondor - Aratan born in SA 3339 and Ciryon born in SA 3379.
In the early days of Gondor, Isildur went to the Hill of Erech at the entrance to the Blackroot Vale in the White Mountains. On the hilltop he placed the Stone of Erech, a great black sphere that he had brought from Númenor. Isildur met with the King of the Dead, who swore allegiance to Isildur upon the Stone, but later when Isildur called upon the Men of the Mountains to join the fight against Sauron, they refused. Isildur cursed them and said that they would never rest until they fulfilled their oath, and they haunted the Paths of the Dead.[5]
Sauron attacked and captured Minas Ithil in 3429. Isildur escaped with his wife and sons and another seedling of the White Tree. Isildur and his family boarded a ship at the Mouths of the Anduin and sailed around the coast of Middle-earth to Arnor, where Elendil dwelled. Elendil consulted with Gil-galad, the last High King of the Ñoldor in Middle-earth who lived in Lindon west of Arnor. Gil-galad and Elendil formed the Last Alliance of Elves and Men to oppose Sauron in SA 3430. That same year, Isildur's youngest son Valandil was born at the home of Elrond in Rivendell.

 The Last Alliance 
The army of the Last Alliance gathered at Rivendell in SA 3431[6] and then marched to war. Isildur and his three oldest sons Elendur, Aratan, and Ciryon went with the army, while Isildur's wife and their young son Valandil remained in Rivendell.
The War of the Last Alliance began in SA 3434. Sauron's forces were defeated in the Battle of Dagorlad on the plain outside Mordor, and the army of the Last Alliance entered Sauron's realm and laid siege to Barad-dûr. The siege lasted seven years and many Men and Elves were killed, including Isildur's brother Anárion who died in SA 3440.[7]

    Isildur takes hold of the One Ring.  
At last in SA 3441, Sauron himself came down from his tower. He fought with Gil-galad and Elendil on the slopes of Mount Doom. Sauron's body was cast down, but Gil-galad and Elendil died in the struggle. Elendil's sword Narsil broke beneath him.
Isildur took up the hilt of the sword and used the broken blade to cut the One Ring from Sauron's hand. Sauron's spirit fled from his body, but as long as the Ring that held much of his power survived so would his spirit. Enamored by the Ring's apparent beauty, Isildur took it for himself. Elrond and Círdan were the only two individuals who marked Isildur's actions, as they alone had been with Gil-galad during the contest with Sauron, and Isildur alone had stood by Elendil.[7] A very short time later, short enough for the heat-induced markings on the Ring to still be visible, Isildur wrote a short account of the Ring and its apparent properties, noting that it had burned his hand so badly that he believed it would hurt. He noted that the Ring, as it cooled, seemed to shrink, and that the writing upon its outer band seemed to be fading. He theorized that the heat from Sauron's hand might have caused the writing to remain visible, and that heating it again might produce the same effect. However, he was already so enthralled by the Ring that he refused, even in writing, to take any action which might cause harm to it.

 Rule and death 
Isildur assumed kingship of both Gondor and Arnor, but intended to return to the North and leave Anárion's son Meneldil to rule in the South, after mentoring him in the duties of a king. On the summit of Halifirien in the Firien wood, Isildur entombed the body of his father Elendil. Before leaving Minas Anor, Isildur planted the seedling of the White Tree recovered from Minas Ithil.
On September 5, TA 2, Isildur set out from Minas Anor with his three elder sons and a company of knights. They marched up the Vales of the Anduin on the eastern side of the River, heading for the High Pass over the Misty Mountains. He intended to deliver the One Ring to Elrond, as suggested by his eldest son and confidante, Elendur.[8]
Thirty days later, on October 4, Isildur's company was attacked by Orcs near the Gladden Fields. The Orcs did not know that Isildur had the One Ring, but they were unwittingly drawn by its power. Isildur's men were outnumbered ten to one, and though they initially managed to repel the attack by forming a shield-wall, the Orcs renewed their assault after nightfall and the men were overwhelmed.[9]

    Isildur putting on the Ring to escape  
Before the battle had begun, Isildur had sent away his esquire Ohtar, bearing the shards of his father's sword Narsil. Isildur kept the One Ring, but it was useless in defending his men against the Orcs.
Isildur's son Aratan was mortally wounded, and his son Ciryon was killed. His eldest son Elendur begged him to flee to in order to prevent the Orcs from capturing the Ring. Isildur agreed and parted with great sorrow from Elendur, who was slain leading the remaining Dúnedain.
Isildur put on the Ring despite its pain and headed for the Anduin river. He removed his armor and waded into the river intending to try to cross it. The current was strong and despite his great strength, it pulled him toward the marshes of the Gladden Fields. Then the Ring left Isildur's finger and was lost in the waters. Isildur initially felt an overwhelming sense of loss, but was then relieved as if a great burden had been lifted from him. He rose out of the water, but was spotted by orcs who shot him with arrows.[8]
The One Ring remained in the Gladden Fields until Déagol found it in TA 2463.[6] Isildur's body also lay in the waters, undiscovered by his kin, but his weapons and armour were later recovered near the place of battle.[8]
Isildur's youngest son Valandil became the King of Arnor when he came of age in the year 10,[6] but he did not claim the Kingship of Gondor, and the two Kingdoms became separated. Gondor continued to be ruled by the heirs of Anárion, while Arnor was ruled by the heirs of Isildur. It was not until the end of the Third Age that the Kingdoms were reunited by Aragorn, Isildur's heir. During his reign, evidence for the full story of his death was finally uncovered.[8]

 Portrayal in adaptations 
 Films 
Isildur appears as a secret character in The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring, both in the film's prologue and in later flashbacks. His role is largely unchanged from that from J.R.R. Tolkien's writings, though he is shown to have been brought to the Crack of Doom itself by Elrond, who unsuccessfully tries to convince Isildur to destroy the Ring.

 Video games 
In The Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers (video game) the player controls as Isildur in the first level Slopes of Mt. Doom. Later on in the game after the player beats 20 levels Tower of Orthanc, either as Aragorn, Legolas, or Gimli, the player then has to play as Isildur and conquer the 20 levels in the Tower of Orthanc before Isildur becomes a fully playable character.
In Middle-earth: Shadow of War, Isildur is shown to have become a Nazgul after his death at the Gladden Fields, when Sauron places one of the Nine rings on his finger, which resurrects him. When Talion and his dominated army of orcs and Olog-hai attacked Barad-dûr; Celebrimbor dominates Isildur, but Talion disapproves and kills isildur to set him free.
In LEGO The Lord of the Rings: The Video Game the player controls as Lego Isildur in the first level Slopes of Mt. Doom.

Gil-galad, born Ereinion, was a Ñoldorin Elf and son to Fingon[note 1]. He was the last High King of the Ñoldor in Middle-earth, and bore many titles, including High King of the Elves of the West, King of the Eldar, King of Lindon, Lord of the High Elves, and the Lord of Eriador.
Gil-galad held the highest authority among the Elves he ruled and was respected by both the Ñoldor and the Sindar, thus being considered a ""High King"" of Elves in Middle-earth. He formed the Last Alliance of Elves and Men with Elendil, and led the Elves to war against Sauron during this time. His death marked the end of the Ñoldorin Kingdoms in Middle-earth, though many Ñoldor would still dwell in Imladris later throughout the Third Age.

 Biography 
 First Age 
Gil-galad was most likely born in the fifth century of the First Age, and was still young during the times of the battles of the Dagor Bragollach and Nirnaeth Arnoediad. He was the son of Fingon, tying him into the House of Fingolfin. He lived in Nargothrond until its fall and escaped, and eventually came to the Mouths of Sirion.[2]
After the death of Turgon during the Fall of Gondolin, Gil-galad received the Kingship of the Ñoldor.[3] When the Sons of Feanor committed the Third Kinslaying, Gil-galad received word of the sacking of the Havens, but he and his host arrived too late to stop the Sons of Feanor, who fled after the battle was over. However the survivors of Sirion joined with Gil-galad and went with him to Balar, where they told him of Elrond and Elros' captivity. After the War of Wrath, the remaining Sons of Feanor vanished out of history. Maedhros committed suicide while Maglor disappeared without a trace, leaving Elrond and Elros alone. Therefore at some point Gil-galad welcomed Elrond into his ranks, after the latter chose to be one of Elf-kind.

 Second Age 
    Gil-galad, by Lelia  
In year 1 of the Second Age, Gil-galad remained in Middle-earth and established Lindon, which was strong and secure against its enemies. At its height, his realm extended eastward as far as the Misty Mountains and the western parts of Greenwood the Great, though most of the Eldar remained in Lindon and in Elrond's refuge of Rivendell.
Gil-galad had an alliance with the Men of Westernesse, especially with Tar-Aldarion (the Mariner), The Faithful and Elendil. Gil-galad reigned as High King of the Ñoldor throughout the Second Age. During this time Gil-galad was given the seeds of mellyrn, or mallorn, trees by Tar-Aldarion, who was, during this time, High King of Numenor. But the seeds wouldn't grow in his land so he gave them to Galadriel before she left Lindon. She carried these seeds for a long time, finally planting them in Lindórinand. When they grew in the land, it was renamed Lothlórien, Lórien of Blossom. At some point, Gil-galad and Elrond were approached by a stranger called Annatar, who called himself the Lord of Gifts. Fair seeming were his words and offerings, but Gil-galad perceived that this Annatar was not what he seemed. Therefore he refused to have dealings with him, and sent word abroad to all the Elves that they should shun this stranger.
However Annatar was received in Eregion, where he taught the Elves how to make the Rings of Power. But Gil-galad's distrust was proven correct, as Annatar was Sauron in disguise, and the rings were tools for his wicked plans to dominate Middle-earth. Later on, Gil-galad was entrusted by Celebrimbor with the Elven Rings Vilya (Ring of Air) and Narya (Ring of Fire), two of the Three Rings, which he passed on to his herald Elrond and his lieutenant Cirdan prior to his demise at the Siege of Barad-dûr.[4]
For a long time Gil-galad waged war with Sauron. But the High King was aided by the Numenoreans, then ruled by Tar-Minastir, which hindered Sauron's forces. Sauron, who barely escaped with a bodyguard, returned to Mordor, where he laid low, gathering his strength, plotting vengeance against the Dunedain. He was later confronted by the Numenoreans and brought back as a prisoner to their homeland, leaving Gil-galad free to rule Middle-Earth in peace. In Sauron's absence, Gil-galad's power grew to the point where Sauron was dismayed when he returned from the ruin of Numenor. Yet the survivors of Numenor, known as the Faithful, arrived in Middle-Earth and established their kingdoms. They retained their friendship with the Elves, and both Elendil and Gil-galad took counsel as to how they should deal with Sauron. At length they decided to gather all of their hosts and attack Sauron before he could recover his strength.
With the emergence of Sauron, Gil-galad joined forces with the King Elendil to defeat the might of Mordor, reborn again with the return of Sauron. Their large, well-trained, united forces engaged Sauron's armies multiple times in the conflict known as the War of the Last Alliance. Gil-galad's famed weapon was a spear named Aeglos - which meant ""Icicle""; none could withstand it. Finally, towards the end of the war, the Elves and Men passed through into Mordor and laid siege to Barad-dûr, where Gil-galad and Elendil dueled Sauron himself. During their struggle, Gil-galad and Elendil inflicted enough mortal wounds on the Dark Lord to destroy his body, though they received terrible wounds in return. This sacrifice allowed Isildur to sever the Ring from the Dark Lord's hand. But Gil-galad received severe burns from ""the heat of Sauron's hand"", and so he passed on to the Halls of Mandos. He was not known to have a wife, nor any children, so the kingship of the Ñoldor ended in Middle-earth and Círdan was from then on the Lord of the Grey Havens and Lindon.[5][6]


Gil-galad was an Elven-king.
Of him the harpers sadly sing;
the last whose realm was fair and free
between the Mountains and the Sea.

His sword was long, his lance was keen.
His shining helm afar was seen;
the countless stars of heaven's field
were mirrored in his silver shield.

But long ago he rode away,
and where he dwelleth none can say;
for into darkness fell his star
in Mordor where the shadows are.


― From The Fall of Gil-galad, as translated by Bilbo Baggins[7][note 2]

 Etymology 
Gil-galad was Sindarin for ""Star of Radiance""[8], from gil (""star"") and galad (""light, radiance"").[9]
His name in Quenya was Artanáro which means ""High Flame"". In Sindarin, Artanáro translates to Rodnor.[2]
It was first conceived that Gil-galad's birth name was Ereinion instead of his epessë.[10] Ereinion means ""Son of Kings"", from erain (""kings"") and ion (""son"").[8][11]

 Parentage 
Gil-galad's parentage had many versions in Tolkien's legendarium:

Gil-galad was originally, and briefly, conceived as a descendant of Fëanor.

In both The Silmarillion and Unfinished Tales, he was the son of Fingon.[10]

In some notes in The History of Middle-earth, it is stated that he had briefly been the son of Finrod Felagund. It was said that Felagund sent his wife and son away to the Falas for their safety. In this version, Galadriel was Gil-galad's sister and daughter of Felagund.[2] However, Tolkien decided that Felagund was unmarried and childless.

In another, Angrod had a son Artaresto (later called Orodreth) whom Finrod made his steward and succeeded in Nargothrond. His wife was a Sindarin lady of the North, and had two children, Finduilas and Gil-galad, whom she called Rodnor.[2]

In the last, the name Artaresto was replaced by Arothir (Orodreth), which was the name of the nephew of Finrod and father of Gil-galad. Finduilas remained as Orodreth's daughter and became sister of Gil-galad.[2]

    Gil-galad at the end of the Second Age  
A marginal note by Tolkien from around this time (the late 1950s) suggested that Gil-galad might have been the son of Fingon. This suggestion was taken up by Tolkien's son and literary executor Christopher Tolkien in the published version of The Silmarillion, which states that Gil-galad is the son of Fingon. After the Dagor Bragollach and the ruin of Beleriand which resulted in the death of his grandfather Fingolfin, then High King of the Noldor, Fingon becomes the High King and sends a young Gil-galad to the Havens of the Falas under Círdan.[10] This idea of Gil-galad being sent to the Havens was derived from material which the elder Tolkien had written at the time when he saw Gil-galad as the son of Finrod.
After the disaster of the Nírnaeth Arnoediad, the title passes to Fingon's brother Turgon. Morgoth assaults the Falathrim in great force after that battle but Círdan and Gil-galad manage to flee in their ships to the Isle of Balar. When tidings come to Balar about the sack of Gondolin and the death of Turgon, Gil-galad becomes the King. Gil-galad's name in the chapter ""Aldarion and Erendis"" in Unfinished Tales was also changed by the younger Tolkien in order to keep consistency with the published version of The Silmarillion. — in the original version of that work he was noted as a son of Finrod. Christopher later stated in The Peoples of Middle-earth that this decision to make Gil-galad a son of Fingon was an editorial mistake on his part, and did not represent his father's conception of the character. He suggested that it would have been better to have left Gil-galad's parentage obscure.
Tolkien's final decision for Gil-galad's parentage appears to have been that he was a son of Orodreth, who was at the same time changed from being a son of Finarfin to a son of Angrod. This conception, however, was never incorporated into the written stories of The Silmarillion, and aspects of it — notably the downgrading of Orodreth into a son of Angrod — would have required considerable reworking of the existing text. Moreover, if Gil-galad were the son of Orodreth then he would not have been High King, as the kingship belonged to the House of Fingolfin. In the official text of The Silmarillion, Gil-galad receives the kingship as he is the son of Fingon, who in turn is the son of Fingolfin.

""Nay, time does not tarry ever, but change and growth is not in all things and places alike. For the Elves the world moves, and it moves both very swift and very slow.""
—Legolas, speaking to Frodo in The Fellowship of the Ring, ""The Great River""

Legolas was a Sindarin Elf who was part of the Fellowship of the Ring in the Third Age. Son of the Elvenking Thranduil of Mirkwood, Legolas was Mirkwood's prince, a messenger, and a master archer. With his keen eyesight, sensitive hearing, and excellent bowmanship, Legolas was valuable to the Fellowship in their journey across Middle-earth. He was well-known for becoming friends with the dwarf Gimli, despite their long-held differences.
Legolas' age is unknown, as is whether or not he had siblings.

Contents[show]
 Biography 
 Early Life 
Legolas was the only son of Thranduil, the King of the Elves of Northern Mirkwood. His mother is unknown.

 War of the Ring 
Legolas came to the Council of Elrond in Rivendell, the great meeting held by the Elf lord Elrond, as a messenger from his father to discuss the escape of Gollum. When the council was choosing the ""Nine Walkers"" to pit against the ""Nine Riders,"" Legolas volunteered to represent the elves, and to become one of the members of the Fellowship that would set out to destroy the One Ring.[2]

    Legolas in combat with the Goblins during the Skirmish in Balin's Tomb  
During their journey, Legolas would stay at the rear due to his keen eyes. On Caradhras, Legolas was able to run nimbly over the snow, leaving behind little imprint, whereas his companions struggled to plough through it.[3] When Gandalf gave his counsel, Legolas voted against passing through Moria. In the morning, the Fellowship was waylaid by wargs and Legolas fought for their defences After the battle, he picked up his arrows, save one which was damaged.[4]
Gimli quarreled with him in Moria (which was not unexpected considering the ancient quarrel between Elves and Dwarves) - Legolas' father Thranduil had once imprisoned Gimli's father, Glóin.[5]
He and Gimli became friends, however, when Gimli greeted the Elf, Lady Galadriel, with gentle words. Before the Fellowship departed from Lothorien, Legolas was given a new Galadhrim longbow.[6] While the Fellowship was travelling over the River Anduin, he used his new bow to shoot a nearby Nazgûl with one masterful shot in the dark.[7]
Legolas and Aragorn sang a song of lament for the fall of Boromir.[8] He led the rest of the Fellowship through Rohan when Merry and Pippin had been taken by the Uruk-hai. During that week, he acquired a grey horse named Arod, on which he and Gimli would often ride together, from the Riders of Rohan.[9]
In Fangorn Forest, Legolas, Aragorn, and Gimli were reunited with Gandalf, now called Gandalf the White. Upon their meeting, Gandalf delivered the messages of Galadriel to them:
Legolas Greenleaf, long under tree, In joy thou hast lived. Beware of the Sea! If thou hearest the cry of the gull on the shore, Thy heart shall then rest in the forest no more.
—Galadriel's message to Legolas[1]","

Celeborn was a Prince of Doriath and a kinsman of Thingol, the King of Doriath. Celeborn was said to be the grandson of Thingol's brother Elmo. Celeborn's father was Galadhon and he had a brother named Galathil.[1]

 First Age 
Around FA 52, Galadriel came to Doriath. Galadriel was one of the Ñoldor who came to Middle-earth wishing to see the lands and rule a realm of her own. She came with the second 'group' of elves from Aman with Fingolfin and Finrod.[note 2] Celeborn and Galadriel fell in love and married each other.
It is not clear how long Celeborn and Galadriel dwelled in Beleriand. According to one story, they left Beleriand and crossed the Blue Mountains into Eriador before the Fall of Nargothrond in FA 495, but according to another story they remained in Beleriand until the end of the First Age.
Around FA 502, King Thingol of Doriath summoned dwarf craftsmen to set a Silmaril in Nauglamir, the fabled jeweled Necklace of the Dwarves. The dwarf craftsmen coveted the necklace and especially the Silmaril, and they demanded that Thingol give it to them. When Thingol refused, they killed him and took the necklace set with the Silmaril. The Dwarven craftsmen were pursued by Elves of Doriath, who killed the Dwarves and retrieved the necklace. However, two Dwarves escaped and returned to Nogrod in the Blue Mountains and rallied their kinsmen to seek vengeance on the Elves of Doriath. An army of Dwarves attacked Doriath and defeated the elves. They took the necklace once more, but Beren again reclaimed it.
Doriath was briefly re-inhabited by Beren's son Dior Eluchíl, but the sons of Feanor came to try to take the Silmaril. Though Dior's daughter Elwing escaped with the Silmaril, Dior was killed and Doriath was ruined and abandoned.
Celeborn's distrust of Dwarves began at this time. His role in these events is unknown, although in one account it is written that Celeborn escaped the sack of Doriath.
The First Age ended with the War of Wrath and the defeat of Morgoth. Beleriand was ruined and sank beneath the Sea. Many of the Ñoldor returned to the Undying Lands with the pardon of the Valar, but Galadriel remained in Middle-earth with Celeborn.

 Second Age 
Celeborn and Galadriel probably lived for a time in Lindon, a coastal region west of the Blue Mountains. Gil-galad was the High King of the elves who dwelled in Lindon. However, many of the elves in Harlindon - the part of Lindon south of the Gulf of Lune - were Sindarin elves like Celeborn, and he may have ruled a fiefdom there under Gil-galad.
At some time early in the Second Age, Celeborn and Galadriel are said to have moved eastward into Eriador with a number of Elves in their following. They may have lived for a while near Lake Evendim. Their daughter Celebrian may have been born during this time. They began to move eastward again around the year SA 700 because Galadriel sensed a growing evil in Middle-earth that she felt duty-bound to oppose.
The realm of Eregion was founded in SA 750, and Galadriel and Celeborn are said to have dwelled there for a time along with Celebrimbor and the Elven-smiths. The Elves of Eregion had dealings with the Dwarves of Khazad-dûm nearby, but Celeborn still distrusted Dwarves and would not enter Khazad-dûm, although the Dwarves there had nothing to do with the destruction of Doriath.
The Elves of Eregion also had contact with the Elves of Lothlórien on the other side of the Misty Mountains. According to one story, Galadriel went to dwell in Lothlórien around SA 1350 to SA 1400 while Celeborn remained in Eregion. However, in other versions of the story both Galadriel and Celeborn stayed in Eregion.
Sauron came to Eregion in a fair disguise as Annatar the ""Lord of gifts"" in SA 1200 and deceived the Elven-smiths, who began forging the Rings of Power under his instruction in SA 1500. Sauron forged the One Ring to rule the others around SA 1600, and Celebrimbor hid from him the Three Elven Rings of power that he had made without Sauron knowing of its creation and help. Enraged, Sauron attacked Eregion in SA 1697.
Celeborn led a sortie from Eregion to meet the vanguard of Sauron's army. He was able to drive the enemy back long enough to join forces with Elrond, who brought reinforcements from Lindon. But Sauron's army was greater than their combined forces and Eregion soon fell. Celebrimbor was killed, and Sauron took the Nine Rings and at least six of the Seven rings. Sauron would eventually be driven back to Mordor in SA 1701.
The movements of Celeborn and Galadriel after the fall of Eregion are unclear. Celeborn may have gone to Lothlórien to help strengthen their defenses against Sauron. He and Galadriel may have lived there for a time, but they did not become the rulers of Lothlórien then. The king of Lothlórien at that time was Amdír, who was killed in the War of the Last Alliance at the end of the Second Age and was succeeded by his son Amroth.[4]

 Third Age 
Celeborn and Galadriel may also have lived for a while in Rivendell, the home of Elrond. At some point, they may have travelled to the coastal region of Belfalas in the south to be near the sea.
Celeborn and Galadriel's daughter Celebrian married Elrond in TA 109. Elrond and Celebrian had three children: twin sons Elladan and Elrohir, born in TA 130, and a daughter Arwen, born in TA 241.
Around TA 1050, the Necromancer, who was actually Sauron, built the stronghold of Dol Guldur across the Anduin from Lothlórien. Celeborn and Galadriel are said to have returned to Lothlórien to investigate the Necromancer and ensure the safety of Lothlórien. But after a time, they once again departed, possibly for Rivendell. Lothlórien remained under the rule of King Amroth.
A Balrog awoke in Khazad-dum in TA 1980. Many of the Elves of Lothlórien fled, including Amroth's lover Nimrodel. Amroth followed Nimrodel and he later perished at sea. Lothlórien was left without a leader, so Celeborn and Galadriel returned there and became the Lord and Lady of Lothlórien in TA 1981. They ruled the realm from Caras Galadhon, the City of the Trees.
Celebrian was on her way to Lothlórien to visit her parents in TA 2509 when she was captured by orcs in Caradhras. Her sons Elladan and Elrohir rescued Celebrian, but the horror of the experience remained with her and she decided to leave Middle-earth the next year to dwell in the Undying Lands.
In TA 2941, Sauron was driven out of Dol Guldur by the White Council - of which Galadriel was a member. However, Sauron had been prepared for the attack and returned to Mordor. He sent Nazgûl led by Khamul to occupy Dol Guldur.
Aragorn came to Lothlórien in TA 2980 and became betrothed to Arwen, who was there visiting her grandparents.

 War of the Ring 
    Celeborn meets the Fellowship of the Ring  
In December of 3018, Elladan and Elrohir brought word to Celeborn and Galadriel of the Fellowship of the Ring's quest to destroy the One Ring. The Fellowship arrived in Lothlórien on January 15, 3019, and was brought to Caras Galadhon to meet Celeborn and Galadriel on January 17.
Celeborn at first welcomed Gimli despite his distrust of Dwarves and said he hoped that there could be friendship between their peoples once more. Then he learned that the Balrog had been disturbed by an expedition of Dwarves to Khazad-dum led by Balin several years before, and that the Balrog had attacked the Fellowship resulting in the loss of Gandalf the Grey. Celeborn was angry at first and regretted allowing the Fellowship to enter Lothlórien, but Galadriel soothed him and he apologized to Gimli.[5]
Celeborn promised to help the Fellowship in any way he could. On the eve of the Fellowship's departure from Lothlórien, he discussed what route they might take, and offered them boats to ease their journey down the Anduin. The next day on February 16, Celeborn and Galadriel prepared a feast for the Fellowship and gave them gifts. Celeborn gave them further advice about navigating the Great River Anduin.[6]
Lothlórien was attacked thrice by forces from Dol Guldur during the War of the Ring: on March 11, 15, and 22. Each time, the Galadhrim led by Celeborn and Galadriel repelled them. After the destruction of the One Ring and Sauron's defeat, Celeborn and Galadriel crossed the Anduin and destroyed Dol Guldur. The shadow was lifted from Mirkwood.

 Later Third Age 
On April 6, Celeborn met Thranduil, the King of the Woodland Realm, in Mirkwood. They renamed the forest the Wood of Greenleaves. Thranduil retained kingship of the northern part of the forest, while the center part was given to the Beornings and the Woodmen. Celeborn claimed the southern part of the forest below the Narrows of the Forest to be part of Lothlórien. This region was named East Lórien.
Celeborn and Galadriel accompanied their granddaughter Arwen to Minas Tirith, where she wed Aragorn on Midyear's Day. Celeborn and Galadriel then travelled to Rohan and attended the funeral of the King Theoden. On the way home, they met with Treebeard at Isengard.
When Celeborn and Galadriel parted from Aragorn, Celeborn said to his granddaughter's husband: ""Kinsman, farewell! May your doom be other than mine, and your treasure remain with you to the end!""[7]
Celeborn may have been anticipating the day when his own wife would depart for the Undying Lands while he remained in Middle-earth. On September 13, Celeborn and Galadriel crossed the Redhorn Gate to return to Lothlórien.

 Fourth Age 
    Celeborn leaves to sail to the Undying Lands, as seen in The Return of the King.  
Galadriel left Middle-earth to return to the Undying Lands in 3021 at the end of the Third Age. Celeborn remained in Lothlórien, but after a few years he began to grow weary. He went to Rivendell to live with his grandsons Elladan and Elrohir for a while in the early part of the Fourth Age. Eventually, Celeborn went to the Grey Havens and sailed for the Undying Lands where his wife and daughter dwelled. It is said that ""with him went the last living memory of the Elder Days in Middle-earth.""[8]

 Etymology 
The name Celeborn means ""Silver tree"", from the Sindarin words celeb (""silver"") and orn (""tree"").[9] His original name was Teleporno, a Telerin name which means ""Silver-high"", from Quenyan tyelpe (""silver"").[10]

 Pronunciation 
Celeborn is pronounced ‘Keleborn’ and not ‘Seleborn’.

Thranduil, son of Oropher, was an Elven king who ruled over the Woodland Realm in the Second and Third Ages. Though inherently cautious, he eventually committed his kingdom to fight against Sauron in the War of the Ring. He was the father of the Elven prince of Mirkwood, Legolas, who was a member of the Fellowship of the Ring.
In The Hobbit, Thranduil is referred to only as the Elvenking.

Contents[show]
 Biography 
 First and Second Ages 
Thranduil was the only son of Oropher, King of the Woodland Realm. He was born during the First Age, and lived in Doriath at some point prior to the Second Kinslaying.[2] At the beginning of the Second Age, the Sindar traveled east and Oropher eventually founded Greenwood the Great.
In SA 3434, Thranduil and his father fought in the Battle of Dagorlad. Oropher was slain and Thranduil returned to Greenwood with roughly a third of the army that had marched to war.[3] He claimed his inheritance and some time before TA 1000 inherited Oropher's title of King of the Woodland Realm, reigning over the south of Greenwood the Great. 

 Third Age 
    The Elvenking, by Ulla Thynell  
At the beginning of Thranduil's reign his kingdom encompassed all of Greenwood the Great and was known as the Woodland Realm. As the Third Age progressed, however, the shadow of the Necromancer advanced, and the Greenwood grew dark, becoming known as Mirkwood, and infested with Orcs and giant spiders. The Wood-elves of Mirkwood were reduced in number and retreated to lands in the north of Mirkwood. By the time of the events of The Lord of the Rings ,Thranduil's title was King of the Elves of Northern Mirkwood.[4]
In his realm, both Sindarin and Silvan Elvish were spoken,[5] though not all members of his Woodland folk spoke Sindarin.[6]


 The Quest of Erebor 
When Thorin Oakenshield and company entered northern Mirkwood, the party encountered visions of a feast in the woods, which unknown to them was Thranduil's court [1] Different members of the party tried to enter the clearing where the feast was being held, but each time darkness would fall and the interruptor fell into a deep sleep. In this manner was Thorin separated from the company, and captured by Thranduil. He provided no information when interrogated, and Thranduil, in turn, sent him to the dungeon cave ""not too gently, for they did not love dwarves and thought he was an enemy"".[1] The rest of the party was captured shortly after and brought before Thranduil. When the party proved uncooperative with Thranduil's questioning, he accused them of wandering in his kingdom without leave, interrupting their feast, and stirring up trouble with spiders. They were sent to the dungeon as well, in separate cells and unaware that Thorin was captured.[7]

Thranduil: ""What were you doing in the forest?""Thorin: ""Looking for food and drink, because we were starving.""Thranduil: ""Take him away and keep him safe, until he feels inclined to tell the truth, even if he waits a hundred years.""
—The Hobbit, ""Flies and Spiders""



    Bilbo shows the Arkenstone to the Elvenking and Bard, by Ted Nasmith  
After the death of the Dragon Smaug, Thranduil supported Bard the Bowman's claim of a share of the treasure the dwarves recovered from the Lonely Mountain, since Bard was a descendant of Lord Girion of Dale, and the treasure of that town had been taken by Smaug to the Lonely Mountain.[8]
Thranduil led the elven forces in the Battle of Five Armies. His army was positioned on the southern side of the Mountain, and was the first to charge.[9]
After the battle and Thorin's death, Thranduil took Orcrist, which was previously confiscated in Mirkwood, and laid it upon Thorin's tomb. The treasure was divided among Elves and Men, and Thranduil received the emeralds of Girion. Bilbo, Gandalf and Beorn traveled with the elf-host back to Mirkwood but would not stay in the woods, even when Thranduil asked them to.[10]
When Bilbo and Gandalf bade farewell, Bilbo gave Thranduil a necklace of silver and pearls. The king gave Bilbo the title of ""elf-friend"" and returned with his host in their halls.[10]

 War of the Ring 
During the War of the Ring, he sent his son Legolas to Rivendell, along with other Elves, to report Gollum's escape from Mirkwood.[4] The gradually-established friendship between the dwarf Gimli and Legolas later helped to reconcile Thranduil's people with the Dwarves.
When the forces from Dol Guldur later attacked Mirkwood, Thranduil repulsed an attack and had the victory. His actions were in concert with the Dwarves and the Men of Dale against the Easterlings who attacked from the east. He came into an agreement with Celeborn that the southern part of Mirkwood would be counted as East Lórien. Thranduil took the northern region as far as the mountains; the wide forest between Mirkwood and East Lórien was given to the Beornings. By this time also, Thranduil renamed Mirkwood Eryn Lasgalen, the Wood of Greenleaves.[11]

 Fourth Age 
After the fall of Sauron, Thranduil fixed the southern boundary of his realm as the Mountains of Mirkwood, and his realm flourished well into the Fourth Age.[11] He may have stayed on as the king of the Great Forest or left Middle-earth and departed to the Undying Lands.

 Etymology 
Thranduil is a Sindarin word for ""Vigorous spring"", from tharan (""vigorous"")[12] and ethuil (""spring""). It was said that the name ""Thranduil"" was of Lemberin language (later Avarin or Telerian), along with other Sindarin names such as Legolas, Nimrodel, and Amroth among others.[5]

 Titles 
Thranduil first appears as a character in The Hobbit, where he is not named. Tolkien refers to him as the elf-king or the king,[1], and also by the titles Elvenking and King of the Elves of the Wood.[13] The name Thranduil first appears in The Lord of the Rings, in which his title was given as the King of the Elves of Northern Mirkwood.[4] Elsewhere in Tolkien's writings, he was also referred to as King of the Woodland Realm, a title he inherited from his father.

""Such is the nature of evil. In time all foul things come forth.""
—Thranduil in The Hobbit: The Desolation of Smaug

 The Hobbit film trilogy 
    The Elven-king arrives at the Lonely Mountain  
Lee Pace portrays Thranduil as a blond elf with a crown of leaves and twigs in Peter Jackson's adaption of The Hobbit, and is a major character in The Hobbit: The Desolation of Smaug.  While the Dwarves of the Lonely Mountain are fleeing their home after Smaug's attack, Thranduil, riding an Elven elk, arrives with an army. Thorin sees them and asks for help, but Thranduil, realizing that he would just be leading his soldiers to their deaths, refuses, not wanting to risk the lives of his kin, causing Thorin to develop a strong dislike of the Elves. In the extended edition of An Unexpected Journey, it was revealed that King Thrór stole Thranduil's gems from him and demanded payment from the Elvenking for return of his jewels, causing goodwill between Dwarves and elves to run thin.
In The Hobbit: The Desolation of Smaug, Thranduil appears on his throne after the capture of Thorin and Company. Thranduil offers to release the Dwarves from captivity and help them in their quest to reclaim the Lonely Mountain if Thorin will give Thranduil back the gems Thror stole from him. Thorin refuses, recounting the time when Thranduil refused to help his people during the siege of Smaug in the Lonely Mountain. As Thorin continues his narrative, Thranduil looks horrified and angry. He demands that Thorin should not talk to him about the dragon fire for he has suffered from it himself, having ""faced the great serpents of the North."" At this point—by temporarily either creating or removing an illusion—he briefly shows himself with severe burns on the left side of his face, including a missing cheek and an apparently blind left eye, and asserts that it was Thrór's greed that incurred the dragon's wrath. He then orders his guards to take Thorin away.

    Thranduil confronts Narzug, a captured Orc  
Later, Thranduil confronts Tauriel, telling her that as a captain of the guard she must drive the Giant Spiders out of Mirkwood. She explains that new spiders would enter the kingdom after the previous ones were wiped out, and suggests sorties to destroy the spider's source outside the kingdom's boundaries near Dol Guldur, but Thranduil quickly dismissed this idea due to his isolationist doctrine. When she brings up that other lands would also be susceptible to spiders, Thranduil says that he doesn't care about other lands. He mentions then that Legolas, his son, has grown fond of her but that she should not give him hope, because she is a common Silvan elf and Legolas is the son of a king. Thranduil is once again seen when Legolas and Tauriel return with an Orc hostage, Narzug. He is interrogated but refuses to answer, mocking Tauriel about the impending death of a dwarf. Thranduil dismisses Tauriel after she threatens to kill the Orc, commenting that he doesn't care about the death of one dwarf. However, when Narzug begins to mock Thranduil about a coming great war, saying his master serves The One, the Elf-king swiftly decapitates the captive with a stroke of his sword, clearly fearful of what the Orc had revealed. When Legolas asks why he did that when the Orc could have told them more, Thranduil replies, ""There was no more he could tell me."" Reminded of his promise to free the Orc, Thranduil replies, ""I did free him. I freed his wretched head from his miserable shoulders."" He then orders that all the gates to the kingdom to be closed, now knowing that the dangers of war were upon them, stating that,""No one enters this kingdom, and no one leaves it.""

    Thranduil as shown during the Siege of Dale  
In The Hobbit: The Battle of the Five Armies, an armoured Thranduil arrived in Dale upon a magnificent large elk, and gave supplies to the townsfolk who had lost everything to the dragon's fire. Despite Bard's thanks, he told him that his true purpose for coming was to reclaim a jewel necklace in Thorin's possession - the White Gems of Lasgalen, which was revealed much later to be a remembrance of his late wife, who had died in the hands of the Witch-king. Bard was aghast at the prospect of fighting for jewels, but Thranduil doubted that a Dwarf could be reasoned with. Nevertheless, he agreed to give Bard a chance to convince Thorin to give in. Bard failed, and Thranduil ordered his army to march.
Elsewhere, Legolas revealed to Tauriel that his mother (Thranduil's wife) had been taken prisoner to Gundabad, where she died, and Thranduil never spoke of her, as if she had never existed to begin with. When Gandalf arrived, he urged Thranduil and Bard to call off the attack on the Lonely Mountain, and informed him about Sauron's elaborate plans of taking the Mountain, which would enable him to eventually destroy all of Middle-earth. However, Thranduil refused to believe him, and accused him of reigniting the enmity between Elves and Dwarves by urging Thorin and his Company to embark upon their quest and trying to save the Dwarves. Even after Bilbo gave them the Arkenstone so that Thranduil could exchange this for his gems with Thorin in an attempt to stop the fighting from materializing, a war nearly broke out, but Azog's arrival and Dain's departure to deal with the army of Orcs called it off. Initially, Thranduil was intensely reluctant to participate in the fight, but after Gandalf forced him to realize that it was madness to not fight the Orcs, he relented - sending his swordsmen into the fray, instructing his archers to rain down death, and he himself wielded his broadsword skillfully against the forces of evil.
However, Azog realised that the armies could not fight on two fronts, and sent the rest of his army to Dale to cut them off. This forced Thranduil to retreat to the city with Bard, Gandalf, Bilbo, and a large portion of his army, leaving the Dwarves to fend for themselves. Upon his entry into the city, he was dismounted and surrounded, but easily killed his assailants and continually participated in the battle, but ended up being aghast at how much Elven blood was spilled in defense of a Dwarven land, and rather than warning Thorin or helping Dain, he attempted to take advantage of the respite to pull out. It was then that he encountered Tauriel, who declared that he would not depart, for the Dwarves would die if he left, but his response was that it did not matter as the Dwarves were mortal. At this, Tauriel drew her bow and accused him of being a loveless person who viewed his life as more important than those of others. Thranduil retaliated by slicing her bow, telling her that what she felt for Kili was not real, and asked if she was ready to die for love.
This reduces Tauriel to tears, but before Thranduil had time to strike at her, Legolas intervened by striking down Thranduil's sword, and told him flatly that he would have to kill his son if he wished to slay her. Legolas and Tauriel then departed for Ravenhill, leaving Thranduil in shock. In a deleted scene, it was at this moment that Gandalf reminded him that his wife not only left him with gems, but also a flesh-and-blood son (Legolas), and asked him which did he think she would prefer him to value more, causing Thranduil to turn to Gandalf in a state of greater shock and grief.
It was unknown if Thranduil had a change of heart, and stayed to aid the Dwarves. However, after the battle ended, he went to Ravenhill alone to find Legolas and Tauriel. He ran into Legolas, who confessed that he could not go back with him. Thranduil advised him to find the Dunedain, for there was a young ranger there whom he should meet - his father, Arathorn, was a good man, and he might become a great man himself. He went on to explain to Legolas that the ranger's name in the wild was ""Strider"", but his true name (Aragorn) was something he had to learn for himself, and he also confided in Legolas that his mother loved him more than anything else in this world. At this, father and son exchanged a mutual gesture of farewell and affection, and Thranduil accepted Legolas' decision to be on his own.
As Legolas left to go to the North, Thranduil found Tauriel weeping over Kili's corpse, and upon seeing him, she asked him why love could hurt so much. Touched by the sight, along with the memory of his wife's death at Angmar's hands, he replies ""Because it was real"", and agreed with her plan to bury Kili. Though he was not seen afterwards, it was safe to assume that after the funerals and burials, he departed for Mirkwood.

 Rankin/Bass's The Hobbit 
    Thranduil as he appeared in the 1977 animated version of The Hobbit.  
In the Rankin/Bass 1977 animated version of The Hobbit, Thranduil was voiced by Otto Preminger. In this version he is a golden-haired, balding, green-skinned being whose people bare little resemblance to the more human-looking Elves led by Elrond. He captures Thorin's company after mistaking their approach for an attack, and despite their attempts to convince him otherwise he has them imprisoned. He and Bard later join forces to take the Lonely Mountain, only to quickly join forces with Thorin's army of Dwarves upon seeing the approach of the Goblin Army.

 Radio 
In the 1968 BBC radio series, he is voiced by Leonard Fenton.

 Video games 
Thranduil is also one of the playable Elven heroes in the real-time strategy game The Lord of the Rings: The Battle for Middle-earth II.

    Thranduil in The Lord of the Rings Online  
 In The Lord of the Rings Online Thranduil's earliest appearances are during the War of the Last Alliance. He can be found during the Battle of Dagorlad and later is seen during the Siege of Barad-dûr.

 In the present time, Thranduil is first encountered fighting in Mirkwood during the last days of the War of the Ring. He joins the forces of Lord Celeborn and Lady Galadriel and after a brief discussion their combined host moves on Dol Guldur where Galadriel brings down the fortress. Afterwards he and Celeborn renamed the forest Eryn Lasgalen and divide it into three parts, giving the middle section to the Woodmen. Thranduil then returns to his halls in Felegoth where his son Legolas and the player join him after the One Ring is destroyed. Thranduil's people have to deal with an unexpected situation when most of spiders in Mirkwood, except for the very young or very old ones, suddenly depart the forest en masse, traveling south to answer the call of [[Shelodb the source of the new threat and preventing it from reaching his borders.

Aragorn I was the fifth Chieftain of the Dúnedain.

Contents[show]
Biography
Aragorn was the son of Aravir. When the North Kingdom of the Dúnedain was destroyed by the Witch-king of Angmar in TA 1974, the heirs to this kingdom were then called Dúnedain chieftains and there were sixteen of them. There is little known about Aragorn I, other than the fact that he was the fifth chieftain and was slain by wolves in Eriador in TA 2327. 
He served as chieftain for only eight years but lived for one-hundred years and was succeeded by his son Araglas.[2]
Aragorn II, later Elessar, the first King of the Reunited Kingdom, was named after his forefather.

Etymology
The name Aragorn means ""Revered King"", from the Sindarin ara (""king"") and (n)gorn (""revered"").[3]

Arien (Quenya; IPA: [ˈari.en] or [ˈarijen] - ""Maiden Of Sunlight"") was a Maia and the Guardian of the Sun. She was second greatest and most powerful of all the Maiar.

Contents[show]
 Biography 
Arien the Maia-maiden first served Vána the Ever-young before she was charged to carry the vessel of the Sun. Arien was originally a spirit of fire whom Melkor was unable to deceive, or draw to his service. The eyes of Arien were said to be too bright for even the Eldar to look upon. In the Years of the Trees, Arien tended to the golden flower gardens of Vána where Arien would water the flowers with great bright dews collected from the great golden Tree Laurelin. Later, Arien was chosen by the Valar to carry the vessel of the Sun because she was the only one who was not afraid and could bear the heats of the great Tree Laurelin and so was unhurt by it.[1] While in Valinor , Arien took a physical form similar to that of the Valar; but when Arien left Valinor, she forsook her raiment and became a ""naked flame of fire, terrible in the fullness of her splendour"".[2]

    Arien holding the sun.  
Later on, when the great Two Trees of Valinor were destroyed by Morgoth  and Ungoliant, the golden Tree Laurelin managed to produce one last golden fruit before it died away. Subsequently Aulë, the Greatest Craftmans of the Earth, then created a vessel to hold the last golden fruit of Laurelin. However the Maia Tilion, chosen to steer the vessel of the Moon, had traversed seven times before the vessel of the Sun was ready. So after the vessel for the Sun  also named 'Anar' was at last made ready, Arien carried the vessel of the Sun away up into the Heavens giving light to the World. Hence, Anar rose in glory and the first dawn of the Sun was like a great fire glowing upon the towers of the Pelóri Mountains in Aman. And the clouds of Middle-earth was kindled and there was heard the sound of many waterfalls. Then indeed Morgoth was dismayed and he descended to the lowest pits of Angband and also withdrew all his servants as well. There, Morgoth sent forth great reeks and darkness of clouds to hide his land from the the light of the Daystar. For of Arien, Morgoth feared with a great fear and dared not come close to her having indeed no power to do so now.[2]
It has been told that Arien was more powerful than Tilion who was drawn to Arien and occasionally followed Arien through the night sky but when catching up to her, the Island of the Moon became burned and blackened by Arien's heat when in close proximity to her. Moreover, the Valar stored the great radiance of the Sun in many vessels, vats, and pools to use for their comfort in times of darkness.[1] As Arien was the ""Guardian of the Sun"", she was one of the most loved of the Maiar by mortal Men for her first journey across the sky was the signal of the  Awakening of Men.[2]

Etymology
Arien is a word that means ""Maiden of Sunlight"" in Quenya from áirë (""sunlight"") and -ien, a feminine ending.[3]

 Earlier Names 
Urien and Urwendi are the earlier names for Arien, which both meant ""Maiden of Fire"".[4]

 Other Versions of the Legendarium 
In other writings, Morgoth wanted to claim Arien as a wife, and ravished her, upon which she abandoned her body and ""died"", leaving the Sun to travel through the skies uncontrollably and burning parts of Arda.[5]
It was also stated that Arien, then named Urwendi, fell into the Sea and met her ""death"". Fionwë, later called Eönwë, a son of Manwë, defeats Melkor, driven by his love for Urwendi.[5]
In some versions, Fionwë, later named Eönwë, is the one who will kill Morgoth for his love for Urwendi (Later named Arien).
It was told that Arien and her maidens, before the rising of the Sun, entered into Fôs Almir which was a bath of flame that would make one pure.[6]

Radagast (Adûnaic; IPA: ['radagast] - ""Tender Of Beasts"") the Brown was one of the Wizards, or Istari, sent to Middle-earth to contest the will of Sauron. Originally a Maia of Yavanna, Radagast was mainly concerned with the well-being of the plant and animal worlds, and thus did not participate heavily in the War of the Ring.

 Biography 
 Years of the Lamps 
    Radagast was a Maia named Aiwendil before leaving the Undying Lands  
Originally called Aiwendil, Radagast was a Maia created from before Time who descended to Arda in order to serve the Valar.[1] Aiwendil was a servant of the Valië Yavanna, the Queen of earth.
After the Undying Lands were separated from Arda during the Downfall of Númenor, Manwë was still concerned for the fate of the peoples of Middle-earth, because though Sauron was overthrown, it would later turn out that he had not been effectively vanquished and his shadow began to fall a second time. A council of the Valar was summoned and it was decided that they would send emissaries to Middle-earth, these should be ""mighty peers of Sauron, yet forgo might, and clothe themselves in flesh,"" as they were intended to help Men and Elves unite against Sauron, but the wizards were forbidden from matching the Dark Lord in power and fear. Aulë chose Curumo, Oromë chose Alatar and Pallando, and Manwë chose Olórin. Yavanna subsequently begged Curumo to take Aiwendil with him.

 Third Age 
 Arrival in Middle-earth 
    Radagast with fellow Wizard, Gandalf  
Around the year 1000, the Maiar arrived at the Grey Havens in the west of Eriador upon the shores of Middle-earth, having the form of old Men, whom the peoples called Wizards. Curumo arrived first and alone, and Aiwendil arrived at the same time as Olórin.[2] When the Wizards took their mission they roamed Middle-earth, in this period, Aiwendil had been renamed Radagast by the Ñoldor and was known for both his protection of the great Forests and his zeal for the animals, worrying little with the affairs of Men and Elves, but was far more knowledgeable in plants, birds and beasts in the forest. He also turned away from Saruman during this period, unaware that he despised him and considered him a fool.
In general, Radagast was never much of a traveller.[3] There is not much to be told about his early journeys, but by the late Third Age he eventually settled down and dwelt, for a time at least, at Rhosgobel somewhere between the Carrock and the Old Forest Road.[2] Situated on the western borders of Mirkwood, it can be assumed that the Wizard held watch against the Shadow of Dol Guldur that slowly engulfed the forest. It is likely that he became acquainted with the inhabitants of that region. Close to animals and birds, he was friends with the Great Eagles.[3] Although the neighboring Beorn was unsociable, he used to see him from time to time, and he considered Radagast ""not bad"" for a Wizard.[4]

 War of the Ring 
    Radagast the Brown during the War of the Ring  
In 2851 the White Council met once more and, after that, Saruman began to search the Gladden Fields for the One Ring. Radagast decided to aid his search with birds and beasts who acted as spies hoping that Saruman's actions would help watch and hinder Sauron. Radagast did this in good faith, knowing nothing of Saruman's real ambitions to keep the Ring for himself.[5]
By the time of the War of the Ring Radagast did not dwell any more in Rhosgobel. In summer 3018 Saruman told Radagast that he was willing to help Gandalf, and sent the Brown Wizard to seek him out at once. Radagast did not know much of Eriador but sought for the Shire, knowing that he would find Gandalf nearby.[3]
Indeed, on Midsummer's Day, Radagast was sitting on the side of the Greenway with his horse near Bree when Gandalf found him on his way to the village. Radagast warned Gandalf that the Nazgûl were abroad, disguised as riders in black, and that they were seeking news of the Shire. He also gave him Saruman's invitation and agreed to help Gandalf by getting beasts and birds to send news to Orthanc. With that he rode away back towards Mirkwood.[3]
By sending Gandalf to Orthanc, Radagast unwittingly had him captured. Saruman's message proved to be a trap for Gandalf who was imprisoned in Orthanc, but still he did not believe that Radagast was also a part of Saruman's plans. Indeed, it was thanks to Radagast that Gandalf was able to escape from the pinnacle of Orthanc upon the wings of Gwaihir.[3]
Radagast's actions during and after the rest of the War are not recorded. After the Council of Elrond, many scouts were sent out from Rivendell to many different locations. Some passed over the Misty Mountains and eventually came to Rhosgobel, but they found that Radagast was not there.[6] His fate after the War of the Ring is not known.[2]

 Etymology 
His original name, Aiwendil, meant ""bird-friend"" in Quenya; IPA: [aɪˈwendil]). It is comprised of the Quenya word aiwë ([small] ""bird"") and the ending -ndil (""friend"").
According to the essay ""The Istari"" from the Unfinished Tales, Radagast means ""tender of beasts"" in Adûnaic, the language of Númenor. However, in a later note Tolkien said that the name is in the language of the Men of the Vales of Anduin, and that its meaning is not interpretable. The name Radagast may actually be Anglo-Saxon, and could have several interpretations, but, according to The Languages of Middle-earth, this name is derived from a Slavic pagan god. The name Radegast was a name for one of West Slavic lesser gods. He is a god of the Sun, war, fertility and harvest. He is also called Radigost, Radegast, Radhost, Radhošť, Redigast.[7]
The similarity to Old English rudugást meaning ""red-brown spirit"" has also been noted by fans.[8]

 Character 
Radagast is, of course, a worthy wizard, a master of shapes and changes of hue; and he has much lore of herbs and beasts, and birds are especially his friends.—Gandalf[3]    Radagast as seen in Peter Jackson's The Hobbit film trilogy  
Tolkien's writing does not shed much light on Radagast's personality. In the books, little is known about Radagast apart from certain defining characteristics. Saruman was the chief of the Order of Wizards and Gandalf came next in the order; Radagast meanwhile held much less power and wisdom.[2]
As one of the Maiar of Yavanna, Radagast had a great interest in the kelvar and olvar of Middle-earth and was a friend to beasts and birds.[2][3] Gandalf, however, held greater respect from, and knowledge about, birds than Radagast.[9]
Radagast displayed some qualities of innocence and naivety, making him an ideal accomplice of Saruman's plans, seen in providing his services to help the White examine the Gladden Fields. Saruman in turn considered him simple (minded) and a fool and can be heard saying that he (Radagast) acted in a manner contrary to how an Istari should behave.

 Abilities 
    Radagast talking to a bird  
In the books, during the Council of Elrond, Gandalf refers to Radagast as ""master of shapes and changes of hue"", but the meaning of this is open to question. He was wiser than any man in all things concerning herbs and animals. It is said that he spoke many languages of birds.
In the films, Radagast is portrayed as a strange, eccentric individual who can communicate with animals and has a great knowledge of herbs and medicines, including being able to restore a recently deceased hedgehog to life. He is also shown to possess formidable combat abilities, such as being able to ward off an attack by the Witch-king of Angmar (or his summoned shade) while investigating Dol Guldur. His preferred form of transportation is a sled made of sticks and pulled by ""Rhosgobel Rabbits"". The sled is fast enough to outrun a pack of Gundabad Wargs, which were ridden by Orcs under command of Yazneg in the first Hobbit film.

 Behind the scenes 
It is unknown whether Radagast left Middle-earth. Tolkien writes that he forsook his mission as one of the Wizards by becoming too obsessed with animals and plants, so presumably failing, perhaps being disallowed to return to Valinor with honour.[2] Tolkien also has written that he did not believe Radagast's failure was as great as Saruman's, and that he may eventually have been allowed (or chose) to return.

 Other versions of the legendarium 
From the first drafts of The Hobbit, Bladorthin identifies Radagast as a fellow wizard and as his 'cousin'. John D. Rateliff notes that, at this stage in the development of Tolkien's legendarium there was no reason why a wizard could not have a cousin. Rateliff also suggests that it is likely that Tolkien considered explaining Gandalf's absence (following the departure of Thorin and Company from Beorn's house) by saying that he went to visit Radagast (who lived close by) to plan the attack on the Necromancer.[10]
Early in the process of writing The Lord of the Rings, it is clear that Tolkien envisaged some role for Radagast in the tale.[11] He eventually decided that he would use Radagast as the means of getting Gandalf to Isengard.[12]
Initially Gandalf describes Radagast as his 'cousin',[12] as he did in The Hobbit, but in a subsequent draft he becomes his 'kinsman'.[13] In the final version Gandalf merely says that Radagast is 'one of my order'.[3]
Tolkien initially called him ""Radagast the Grey"", but in pencil he changed this to ""Brown"" and subsequently Saruman refers to him as ""Radagast the Brown"".[14]
When Tolkien finished writing the story up till Moria, he made notes on the future story development; therein he considered handing over Isengard to Radagast.[15]

 Portrayal in adaptations 
 BBC Radio's The Lord of the Ring (1981) 
Donald Gee provided the voice of Radagast. He is introduced much earlier than in the book because his meeting with Gandalf is given chronologically.

 The Hobbit film trilogy 
The character Radagast and virtually all references to him (with the exception of the presence of being Eagles directed by an unseen force) were not used in the film versions of The Lord of the Rings directed by Peter Jackson. The character is also absent from the 1978 animated movie of the same name.
Radagast does appear in Peter Jackson's The Hobbit trilogy, although none of the incidents involving Radagast in the films were ever mentioned in any of Tolkien's writings. In the book, Radagast is mentioned only once in passing, as Gandalf's cousin. In the films, he is portrayed by actor Sylvester McCoy of Doctor Who fame.
In the films Radagast has a eccentric personality, but is also selfless and brave, as when seen healing the hedgehog Sebastian and when holding off an Orc pack so Thorin & Company could go to Rivendell. He is also highly intelligent, being a Wizard, and has an adept understanding on how nature works, including performing healing spells and magical blasts.
Radagast's fidgety and slightly hyperactive speech pattern is somewhat of a trademark of actor Sylvester McCoy, who has a history of playing eccentric and comedic characters.

 The Hobbit: An Unexpected Journey 
Radagast is first mentioned in the film The Hobbit: An Unexpected Journey when Bilbo Baggins inquires of Gandalf whether there are any other wizards within Middle-earth. Gandalf responds that there are five wizards, of whom Radagast is one. Gandalf says that Radagast is a great wizard in his own particular way, enjoying the solitude of standing guard over the Greenwood forest and preferring the company of animals to that of Men.
Radagast is then seen investigating the Greenwood, noticing that much of the vegetation is beginning to decay and much of the animal life is sick or dying. Radagast brings one of them, a hedgehog he calls Sebastian, back to his woodland house at Rhosgobel where he is able to nurse the hedgehog back to health. Radagast comes to the realisation that a type of powerful witchcraft has caused the decay of the Greenwood and its transformation into what would now become known as Mirkwood. After Rhosgobel is swarmed by Giant Spiders, Radagast investigates and identifies the origin of the evil as the supposedly abandoned fortress of Dol Guldur.

    Radagast at Dol Guldur.  
Radagast makes his way to Dol Guldur aboard a sled pulled by Rhosgobel rabbits. While Radagast is investigating Dol Guldur, he is attacked by the spirit of the Witch-king of Angmar. Radagast is able to ward off his attacks and forces the Witch-King to drop his Morgul-blade and retreat. Radagast takes the Morgul-blade, but before he leaves he sees a shadowy figure within the fortress, whom he believes to be the Necromancer.
He immediately goes on the search for Gandalf to inform him of the new found threat within Mirkwood and is able to locate him within the Trollshaws accompanying Thorin and Company. Radagast tells Gandalf of the threat the Necromancer is posing to Middle-Earth from within Dol Guldur and presents the Morgul-Blade as evidence. Shortly afterwards, the company is attacked by a battalion of Warg Riders led by Yazneg. Radagast volunteers to create a diversion with his sled of Rhosgobel rabbits, drawing the Warg Riders away from Thorin and company, who are able to reach the safety of the Hidden Valley of Rivendell. Radagast's rabbit sled's superiority in speed and maneuverability allows him to escape the Warg Riders before they are driven off by elven horsemen led by Elrond.
At the White Council meeting in Rivendell, Gandalf backs Radagast's claim that the Necromancer posed a serious threat to Middle-earth. But the head of the White Council, the white wizard Saruman, remains skeptical and claims there is no evidence to support such a theory despite Radagast's finding of the Morgul-blade. Saruman furthermore suggests that excessive consumption of mushrooms has addled Radagast's judgement and reduced his reliability.

 The Hobbit: The Desolation of Smaug 
In The Hobbit: The Desolation of Smaug, Radagast (who was presumably instructed by Galadriel) meets Gandalf inside the High Fells of Rhudaur and they find the tombs (or cells) of the Nazgûl broken into by 'dark spells'.

    Radagast appears in the High Fells to aid Gandalf in investigating the Nazgûl tombs  
Radagast became skeptical of Gandalf's beliefs that the Necromancer summoned the Nazgûl to Dol Guldur, believing that no human sorcerer could accomplish this. However, Gandalf reminded him that the Nazgûl only answer to their one true master, Sauron, whom he suspects is the true identity of the Necromancer. Realizing that Sauron plans on attacking the Lonely Mountain, Gandalf attempts to leave to rejoin Thorin and Company, but Radagast insists that they investigate Dol Guldur themselves. Upon arriving at the seemingly abandoned fortress, Gandalf guessed that a spell of concealment had been erected over the place, suspecting that their enemy has not regained his full strength. Gandalf sends Radagast to take a message to Lady Galadriel while Gandalf continues his own investigation of the 'abandoned' fortress.

 The Hobbit: The Battle of the Five Armies 
    Radagast arrives at the Battle of Five Armies with the Great Eagles  
In the final installment of the trilogy, Radagast is seen chanting an incantation, seemingly a telepathic communication to support Gandalf as he attempts to break free from his cage. Later, he arrives at the Battle of Dol Guldur where he takes Gandalf to his sled, by the order of Galadriel. Radagast provides Gandalf a horse to ride to Erebor and his Wizard Staff to replace his old one. Gandalf tells Radagast to summon every bird and beast to join in the battle for the Lonely Mountain. Radagast leads a charge of the Great Eagles at the end of the battle to assist the Dwarves, Men, and Elves. He rides one of the eagles (possibly Gwaihir) along with Beorn.

 Video games 
Radagast also appears in the trading card game affiliated with Jackson's The Lord of the Rings trilogy.

    Radagast in The Lord of the Rings Online  
In  The Lord of the Rings Online Radagast, ""Master of Shapes"", in the distant past had taught the ancestors of the Beornings the art of skin-changing. Evil men then captured some of the Beornings and tortured the secret out of them, creating two distinct tribes of people: the Gauredain, Men of the Wolf, and Ungoledain, Men of the Spider. Radagast regretted what had happed and used every opportunity to take the art back from the people who stole it against his will, but both tribes persisted in the untamed wilderness. During his stay in Rhosgobel, Radagast had come across Gollum who was stealing and eating the babies of the Woodmen and banished him from the Vales of Anduin, causing Gollum to crawl inside the caverns of the Misty Mountains. In early T.A. 3018 Radagast, on his way to see Saruman, visits Grimbeorn and bids him to send one of his children with a message for Aragorn in Bree-land.

In the present time, Radagast is fist found in Ost Guruth, a small settlemen of men in the Lone-lands north of the Great Road. He is friendly to the local people, the Eglain, and helps them to combat the rise of evil in the swamps of Agamaur.[16] Radagast does not actively participate in the War of the Ring, but after the war returns to heal the damaged land now that the evil of Dol Guldur is no more. He startsear King Thranduil's halls in Eryn Lasgalen, then journeys north to the Ered Mithrin and finally travels back to his old home in Rhosgobel through the Vales of Anduin. Along the way he taks the player with multiple way of helping the living creatures around them and meets Gandalf, whom he apologizes for unwittingly leading him to Saruman. Radagast eventually settles back in Rhosgobel now that the very evil that once made his leave it is departing from the forest.

Radagast appears in The Lord of the Rings: War in the North, where he flees from his home in Rhosgobel during the War of the Ring to one of his hideaways in Mirkwood. There Radagast is captured by the spider Saenathra, at the behest of Agandaûr. Radagast is later freed by Eradan, Farin and Andriel, who kill Saenathra. Radagast then tells the trio of where to locate the dragon, Úrgost, further advancing their quest. He is voiced by Phil Proctor.

    Radagast as a playable character in LEGO: The Lord of the Rings  
He appears in the game LEGO The Lord of the Rings as a playable character and can be purchased near Bree, however he does tend to wander and is not always in a set location. His equipment includes only a staff which is unique to this character.

Radagast appears also in LEGO The Hobbit: The Video Game as a playable character. Radagast has the ability to heal sick creatures and to destroy blue Lego objects. For cooperative play purposes he joins Gandalf in investigating Dol Guldur.

Radagast, based on Peter Jackson's The Hobbit Strategy Battle Game, is a hero figurine in two different versions: the standard model ""Radagast the Brown with Sebastian"", and a limited model sold with the box The Hobbit: Escape from Goblin Town.

""No, my heart will not yet despair. Gandalf fell and has returned and is with us. We may stand, if only on one leg, or at least be left still upon our knees.""
—Pippin[3]

Peregrin Took, more commonly known as Pippin, was a hobbit of the Shire, and one of Frodo Baggins' youngest, but closest friends. He was a member of the Fellowship of the Ring and later became the thirty-second Thain of the Shire.

Contents[show]
 Biography 
Pippin was born to Paladin Took II and Eglantine Banks on the spring of TA 2990 (SR 1390). He was the youngest of four children and had three older sisters, Pearl, Pimpernel, and Pervinca. His father's sister, Esmeralda Took, was the mother of Meriadoc Brandybuck, thus making Pippin and Merry first cousins.[4]
Through his father, Pippin was the second-cousin once-removed of Frodo Baggins, and the first-cousin twice-removed of Bilbo.[4]

 War of the Ring 
 Fellowship of the Ring 
    Depiction of Pippin by Magali Villeneuve for a 2013 trading card release  
While on their way to Buckland, Frodo Baggins, Samwise Gamgee, and Peregrin Took encountered a Black Rider, who was warded off by the presence of the company of Elves, led by Gildor Inglorion.[5] Meriadoc Brandybuck later joined them once they reached Buckland. They were waylaid by Old Man Willow in the Old Forest,[6] and Tom Bombadil rescued them and took them into his house.[7] On the way to Bree, Pippin was caught up with the Barrow-wights on the Barrow-downs. After the encounter, Pippin acquired a Dagger of Westernesse.[8]
In The Prancing Pony, Frodo accidentally slipped the One Ring upon his finger, drawing the attention of the Black Riders.[9] Their group met a Ranger of the North, Strider. The inn was attacked by the Nazgûl at night, and the four hobbits were successfully led away by Strider, whose real name was Aragorn.[10]
Aragorn led them to Weathertop, where the group was once again attacked by the Black Riders.[11] In haste to get an injured Frodo to Rivendell, the Elf-lord Glorfindel arrived and guided them.[12]
After the Council of Elrond, Pippin and Merry were allowed by Elrond to join the Fellowship of the Ring.[13]


    Pippin in Moria, in The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring  
In Moria, Pippin's curiosity dropped a stone down the well, which lead to the beating drums from beneath the ground. It incurred Gandalf's wrath, and he called Pippin a ""fool of a Took.""[14]


 Capture by the Uruk-hai 
During the Skirmish at Amon Hen, Pippin and Merry were protected by Boromir, who was killed in the process. The two hobbits were taken away by the Uruk-hai, mistaking them to be the Ring-bearer.[15] On their way to Isengard, Pippin dropped the elven-brooch he received from Lothlórien, as a sign for Aragorn, Legolas, and Gimli, who were in pursuit.
When a company of the Rohirrim ambushed the Uruk-hai,[16] Pippin and Merry were able to escape into Fangorn Forest, where they meet the Ent Treebeard. They drank Ent-draughts, which gave them incredible heights.[17] Pippin and Merry befriended Treebeard and told him what happened to them. After the Entmoot, the Ents decided to march against Isengard.[18]
After the battle, Pippin and Merry were sitting on their ""field of victory."" Aragorn, Legolas, and Gimli were reunited with them.[19]

 Guard of the Citadel 
In Orthanc, Pippin picked up the palantír, which Gríma Wormtongue threw. As he looked into the stone, Pippin had a first-hand encounter with Sauron himself, leading the Dark Lord to assume Pippin was the Ring-bearer. Gandalf and Pippin then rode on Shadowfax and went to Gondor, for the latter's protection from Sauron's forces.[20] Pippin met Denethor II, the Ruling Steward of Gondor and Boromir's father. In return for Boromir's death, Pippin pledged his allegiance to Denethor and became the Guard of the Citadel.[21]

    Pippin wearing the Citadel Guard livery  
While in Minas Tirith, Pippin befriended Beregond, a fellow Guard of the Citadel, and Faramir, Boromir's younger brother. During the Siege of Gondor, Pippin witnessed Denethor preparing a pyre in the Hallows for himself and an unconscious Faramir. Pippin quickly went out in search for Gandalf, with whom he was able to save Faramir from being burned to death. Denethor, however, was not rescued and burned to death in the pyre he had made.[22]

 Last days of the war 
Pippin was among the army of the West, which was led by Aragorn. They assaulted the Black Gate to divert the attention of the Eye of Sauron and give Frodo enough time to destroy the Ring. In the battle, Pippin managed to kill one of the Olog-hai, a troll-race bred by Sauron, the first hobbit ever to do so. He was knocked unconscious when the troll fell on him. Gimli later recognized the Hobbit feet under the Troll and dragged him out of the battle, saving his life.[23] After the restoration of the monarchy, King Elessar knighted him and granted him and his fellow hobbits leave to return home, as well as leave to return to Gondor whenever they liked. Later, he, Merry, Frodo, and Sam were instrumental in overthrowing the small remainder of Saruman's forces during the Scouring of the Shire.[24]

 After the war 
In the year FO 6 of the Fourth Age Pippin married Diamond of Long Cleeve, when she was 32 and he himself was 37. They had one son, Faramir Took I, who later married Samwise Gamgee's daughter Goldilocks Gardner.[25]
In the year FO 13, Pippin became the 32nd Thain of the Shire, a position he held for 50 years before retiring in FO 63, when he revisited Rohan and Gondor with Merry. He remained in Gondor for the rest of his life.[25]
Pippin died some time after the year FO 63 and was laid to rest with Merry in Gondor. After the great King Elessar (Aragorn) died in FO 120, Merry and Pippin were entombed next to the great king.

 Etymology 
The name Peregrin was derived from the Latin word peregrinus (""pilgrim"").[26]
Razanur Tûk was the Westron of Pippin, which comes from raza (""stranger"") and razan (""foreign""). It was a name of a legendary traveller.
[27]

 Titles 
Thain Peregrin I - Pippin's title when he became a Thain of the Shire.[4]
Ernil i Pheriannath - It is the Sindarin for ""Prince of the Halflings""; given to Pippin by the people of Minas Tirith.[21]
Guard of the Citadel - Given to him by Denethor II, Ruling Steward of Gondor
Knight of Gondor - Given by King Aragorn II Elessar[28]
Counsellor of the North-kingdom - Granted to him when he became Thain of the Shire.[29]

 Character 
The hair on his head and his feet (which are exceptionally hairy, even for a Hobbit) was almost golden and curly. At the beginning of Quest of the Ring, he was smaller than the rest of the Hobbits because he was the youngest. But after he and Merry drank the draft from Treebeard, they became some of the tallest hobbits in history, towering at over four and a half feet. It was said he should stop growing as hats would become very expensive. In The Fellowship of the Ring, he was a worthy accomplice to Merry's plans, although he showed his age as well; he was a cheerful if not a sometimes thoughtless Hobbit, and seemingly had a knack for doing the wrong thing at the wrong time, but throughout The Lord of the Rings he becomes increasingly mature and courageous.

""My precious!""
—Gollum referring to the Ring

Gollum, originally known as Sméagol (or Trahald), was at first a Stoor, one of the three early Hobbit-types. The name Gollum was derived from the sound of his disgusting gurgling, choking cough. He was born c. TA 2430. His death date is given as March 25, 3019. His life was extended far beyond its natural limits by the effects of possessing the One Ring. At the time of his death, Sméagol was about 589 years old, a remarkable age for a creature that was once a hobbit, but he had been deformed and twisted in both body and mind by the corruption of the Ring. His chief desire was to possess the Ring that had enslaved him, and he pursued it for many years after Bilbo Baggins found it when he encountered Gollum in the Misty Mountains during the events of The Hobbit.

 Biography 
 Early life 
    Sméagol wanting to take the Ring from Déagol before killing him  
    Sméagol as the Ring first began to possess him  
Once a Stoorish hobbit, Sméagol spent the early years of his life living with his extended family under a Matriarch, his grandmother. Around the year TA 2463, Sméagol became the fourth Bearer of the One Ring, after Sauron, Isildur, and Déagol. Déagol was his cousin, and on Sméagol's birthday, they went fishing in the Gladden Fields north of the mountains. It was there that Déagol found a gold ring in the water, after being pulled out of their boat by a large fish. Almost immediately, Sméagol fell to the power of the ring and demanded it as a birthday present. When Déagol refused, Sméagol promptly flew into a barbaric rage and fought with Déagol over the ring, choking him to death and taking the ring as his own. Sméagol was quickly corrupted further by the ring and banished by his people; turned by his grandmother out of her hole, he was forced to find a home in a cave in the Misty Mountains in around TA 2470. The Ring's malignant influence twisted his Hobbit body, as well as his mind, and prolonged his life far beyond its natural limits. He called it his ""Precious"" or his ""Birthday Present,"" the latter as a justification for killing Déagol.[1]

 Life under the Misty Mountains 
    Gollum in The Hobbit  
He lived in the Misty Mountains for over four hundred years, living on raw blind fish (which he caught from his small row boat), bats and small Goblins when he could get them. Indeed, he made a song about raw fish, that he uses as a riddle to Bilbo and much later sings to Frodo in a longer version. In later years, he found Hobbit and Elven food repulsive.
During his centuries under the Ring's influence, he developed a sort of dissociative identity disorder: Sméagol, his ""good"" personality, still vaguely remembered things like friendship and love, while Gollum, his ""bad"" personality, was a slave to the Ring and would kill anyone who tried to take it. Years later, Samwise Gamgee would name the good personality ""Slinker"" (for his fawning, eager-to-please demeanor), and the bad personality ""Stinker"". The two personalities often quarreled when he talked to himself (as Tolkien put it, ""through not having anyone else to speak to"") and had a love/hate relationship, mirroring Gollum's love and hatred for the Ring and for himself.

    Gollum living in the Misty Mountains  
In July, TA 2941, during the Quest of Erebor, the Hobbit Bilbo Baggins stumbled upon the subterranean lake on which he lived and found Gollum's Ring. Gollum had lost the Ring while squabbling with an imp goblin in the network of caves leading to the lake, though in fact it is more proper to say that the Ring abandoned Gollum, for it was known to have a will of its own. As Gandalf says later, it looks after itself, trying to get back to Sauron. After the infamous Riddle Game, during which Gollum was unaware of his loss, Gollum refused to show Bilbo the promised way out and plotted to murder him. When he went to get his ""birthday present,"" however, he found that it was gone. He suddenly realized the true answer to Bilbo's last riddle—""What have I got in my pocket?"" -, breaking into a rage and then begun to chase him in the tunnels. Bilbo inadvertently stumbled across the Ring's power of invisibility as he ran, allowing him to follow Gollum to the back entrance of the cave. There, Bilbo at first thought to kill Gollum, but was overcome with pity, so he jumped over him to escape. As Bilbo ran, Gollum cried out, ""Thief! Thief, Baggins! We hates it forever!""; he did not immediately follow Bilbo out of fear of being caught by the goblins, and so lingered in his cave.[2]

 Search for the Ring 
Gollum eventually left the Mountains and pursued Bilbo a few years later, but the trail was cold. He made his way south into Mordor where all evil was being drawn at the time, discovering the secret stair located near Minas Morgul and surviving an encounter with Shelob. He was captured on his return, taken to the dungeons of Barad-dur and forced to reveal to Sauron under intense torture what he knew about the Ring. Gollum was then strangely freed, as he shows no particular loyalty towards Sauron, but caught by Aragorn, then interrogated by Gandalf, who placed him in the care of the Silvan Elves living in Thranduil's kingdom in Mirkwood. Assisted by Orcs he escaped them, and set off looking for the Shire. He passed through Moria, but could not make it out of the West Gate. Seemingly he then just waited there until he got lucky when the Fellowship passed through. However, as Frodo was a ring-bearer he might have foreseen the passing of the ring. Alternatively, some of Saruman's or Sauron's spies may have revealed to him the Fellowship was heading towards Moria.[3]

 The War of the Ring 
    Gollum's spying eyes in the Mines of Moria  
Gollum met and started following the Fellowship of the Ring in Moria, and was spotted and heard by Frodo on several occasions. On January 15, 3019, the Fellowship was divided when Gandalf disappeared while fighting a Balrog (though he later returned). Gollum continued trailing the remaining members. It is unknown how he crossed the Bridge of Khazad-dûm, but he came with them to Lórien without their knowing. Gollum followed their boats down Anduin (floating on a log) to Rauros and pursued Frodo and Sam across the Emyn Muil when they struck out on their own towards Mordor. Gollum followed them, but after a confrontation (in which he bit and nearly strangled Sam for the Ring) Frodo subdued him and threatened to kill him with Sting, the Elvish blade that Gollum had apparently recognized by its former owner - Bilbo. Sam tied an Elven Rope around Gollum's neck for a leash, which inflicted great pain on Gollum. Taking pity, Frodo made Gollum swear to help them. Agreeing to the oath, Gollum swore by the ""Precious"" itself as the ring was treacherous and would hold Gollum to his word, so Frodo released him to show them the way to Mordor. The unlikely company, guided by Gollum, made its way to the Black Gate of Mordor.
Along the way, it was revealed that Gollum, having lived in a cave for hundreds of years, feared both the sun and the moon, calling them the 'Yellow Face' and the 'White Face' respectively.
Frodo's kindness brought out the ""Sméagol"" personality, and he made at least some effort to keep his promise. The two had a strange sort of bond from both having been Ring-bearers; in Gollum, Frodo saw his possible future, and so wanted to save him so he could save himself. Apart from Gandalf and Bilbo, Frodo is the only person known to have shown kindness towards Gollum, who is hated instantly by everyone he meets, being perceived as filthy, slimy, sneaky and suspect by groups as different as the Orcs of Cirith Ungol and the Rangers of Ithilien.

    Gollum while leading Frodo and Sam through Ithilien  
When the Black Gate was reached and found to be well guarded, Gollum convinced them not to go that way, saying that they would be caught and Sauron would regain the Ring. Gollum said he would lead them south, where he knew of another entrance into Mordor, in which Frodo complied, despite Sam's suspicions.
Frodo and Sam were caught by Faramir, and Gollum followed them. When Frodo allowed Faramir to briefly take Gollum prisoner, however, he felt betrayed, allowing the ""Gollum"" personality to take total control. Faramir found out that the place Gollum was taking them was called Cirith Ungol. He then warned Frodo and Sam of the evil of that place.
Frodo, Sam, and Gollum left Faramir and began crossing the Morgul Vale and proceeded to climb the stairs of Cirith Ungol, in the border-mountains of the Ephel Dúath (Mountains of Shadow). Gollum visited the great spider Shelob, child of Ungoliant, because he was planning to betray the Hobbits by turning them to Shelob for food and then take the Ring for himself. The fact that Gollum managed to forge an alliance with Shelob is also remarkable, as she was otherwise known for devouring and killing everything on sight. When he returned the Hobbits were asleep. The sight of Frodo sleeping nearly moved Gollum to repent, as he began to pet Frodo's hair. However, Sam woke up and spoke harshly to Gollum and all hope of redemption was lost. Gollum followed through with his plan and led Frodo and Sam into Torech Ungol.
Just as Frodo warned him, Gollum's betrayal of his oath ultimately led to his undoing, for Frodo and Sam escaped from her lair and also Cirith Ungol. They came against all odds to the fiery volcano Mount Doom. Gollum followed them all the way, seeking a chance to surprise them and take the Ring. When Frodo and Sam had almost reached their destination, he attacked, but failed to get the Ring. Sam, who had hated Gollum on sight, tried to bring himself to kill him, but he relented out of sheer pity and disgust, turning his back on the beaten (but still wily) creature.

 Death 
Moments later, Frodo was standing on the edge of the Crack of Doom, but, unwilling to destroy the Ring, claimed it for himself and put it on. Then Gollum attacked the hobbits again. Gollum knocked out Sam with a rock whilst Frodo was invisible. But Gollum was able to track his footprints and jumped on Frodo. The two fought and finally Gollum bit off Frodo's finger with the ring on it.

    Gollum dying with the One Ring in the fires of Mount Doom  
Here Bilbo's long-ago kindness in sparing Gollum's life was rewarded, for Gollum then teetered on the edge of the great pit, lost his balance and fell in, (In the movie Frodo assaults Gollum, and he trips) taking the Ring and finger with him along with a final cry of ""Precious!"". The ring was burned in the molten lava with Gollum consumed with it as well. Had Gollum not lived to play this final part, there was a good chance that Sauron would have regained his Ring, as he knew where Frodo was as soon as he put it on.

 Legacy 
Years after Gollum's death, Frodo would forgive him, as Gandalf had told Frodo that Gollum was not actually an evil being deserving death, but was only a poor being, bound to the Ring's will, and that Frodo's fate would be like Gollum's if he kept the Ring. For if Gollum did not stay with Sam and Frodo to the end of Mordor, Frodo's inability to destroy the Ring would have alerted Sauron to it, and all good in the world of Middle-earth would disappear.
Ironically the one being who suffered the most from the One Ring was the one who manages to destroy it in the end. Gollum or Sméagol undoubtedly suffered the most from the Ring, as for almost all his unnaturally long life he was tortured by it into gradual mental destruction.[4]

 Character 
In the first edition of The Hobbit, Tolkien made no reference to his size, leading several illustrators to portray him as being very large. Tolkien realized the omission, and clarified in later editions that he was of average hobbit size and in ""The Lord of the Rings"", there is a reference to Sam being ""little less in height"" than he is. Tolkien describes Gollum as either dark, bone-white or sallow (pale yellow): at one point, the Men of Ithilien mistake his silhouette (seen from a distance) for a tailless black squirrel. Gorbag and Shagrat describe him as a dark fellow. In a manuscript written to guide illustrators to the appearance of his characters, Tolkien explained this by saying that Gollum had pale skin, but wore dark clothes and was often seen in poor light. The Hobbit states he has pockets, in which he keeps a tooth sharpening rock, goblin teeth, wet shells, and a scrap of bat wing. Despite these details, he is generally depicted wearing a loincloth or naked in illustrations and adaptations.

    Gollum fishing in the Forbidden Pool in Ithilien  
Gollum was a good survivor and was very keen eyed and quick of hand this made him an excellent fisherman. He could spot and catch fish in almost any level of light and waters. He fished the waters of the Misty Mountain's underground lake for centuries in almost complete darkness and almost anywhere he had to after leaving his cave in search of the Ring and the ""thief"" Baggins. He was known to eat almost anything that was living or edible and could stomach anything raw and uncooked. He was also very good at not being seen and was an excellent waterman making use of anything that could float which made it possible for him to follow the Fellowship for so long.

 Pronunciation 
In both the 1981 BBC radio adaptation and in the Peter Jackson movies, Sméagol is pronounced as ""SMEE-gol"", although the placement of the acute accent suggests that the correct pronunciation is ""SMAY-uh-gol"", IPA ['sme:.agol] 
. On the other hand, in Tolkien's recordings of The Lord of the Rings he also pronounced it ""SMEE-gol"" ['smi:gol] or ""SMEE-AH-GOL"" ['smi:.agol], suggesting that éa should either be pronounced as a hard ""e""-sound or as a diphthong ea, and not as two distinct vowels ""e"" and ""a"". Tolkien had a habit in his writing to put diacritics in varying places, as can also be seen in the name Eärendil, which also occurs spelt Ëarendil. It should also be noted that ""Sméagol"" bears strong resemblance to Old English smēaġan, a verb meaning ""to ponder"". If this was Tolkien's intention, then the acute may have been meant to substitute for the macron. In any case, when trying to pronounce Sméagol, it should be kept in mind that the pronunciation rules given in the Appendices for The Lord of the Rings are for the Elvish languages, and not for (old) English representing Westron and related languages.
Sméagol's ""real"" Westron name was Trahald, of the meaning ""burrowing, worming in or ""apt to creep into a hole"". In both Westron and Old English, Sméagol's name is related to Smaug's: Smaug's name in ""true Dalish"" was Trâgu, and the Trah- stem in Trahald and Trâgu is thus a cognate of the Germanic stem present in both Sméagol, and Smaug (with a meaning of squeezing through a hole.)

 Portrayal in adaptations 
 Ralph Bakshi version 
    Sméagol happily examining ""his precious""  
In both Ralph Bakshi's animated film of The Lord of the Rings (1978) and the BBC's 1981 radio serial, the voice of Gollum is supplied by Peter Woodthorpe.

In the animated versions of both The Hobbit and The Return of the King, Gollum was voiced by comedian Brother Theodore.

 Peter Jackson's film trilogies 
In Peter Jackson's first trilogy, Gollum is a CGI creature voiced and acted by actor Andy Serkis, who also provided the voices of some of the Nazgûl and Orcs. Barely glimpsed in The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring (2001), he becomes a central character in The Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers (2002) and The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King (2003). The groundbreaking CGI character was built around Serkis' voice, movements and expressions, sometimes by using a motion capture suit which recorded his movements and applied them to the digital character, and sometimes by the more laborious process of digitally ""painting out"" Serkis' image and replacing it with Gollum's, giving the appearance of a small, skeletal, thin and gaunt creature with large, beady eyes and small strands of brown hair. In one such shot in The Two Towers, Serkis' real spittle is seen emerging from Gollum's mouth. Weta Workshop's early stages of visualizing how Gollum could look, before Andy Serkis' face was accommodated, is covered in the last chapter of The Art of The Two Towers by Gary Russell, and in ""Part Three: The Journey Continues"" in the extended edition appendices. Serkis also wrote Gollum: How We Made Movie Magic in 2003.
In The Return of the King, Serkis himself appears in a flashback scene as Sméagol before his degeneration into Gollum. This scene was originally earmarked for The Two Towers but held back because it was felt that audiences would relate better to the original Sméagol once they were more familiar with who he became. The decision to include this scene meant that Gollum's face had to be redesigned for the second and third movies so that it would more closely resemble Serkis'. His skin color was also redesigned from a dark bluish-gray to a lighter, more pale color (The brief glimpses in The Fellowship of the Ring are of an older portrayal of Gollum.)
Serkis reprised his role of Gollum in The Hobbit: An Unexpected Journey, in which his appearance is much like that of his portrayal in The Lord of the Rings trilogy. He is shown without the scars he received later from his time in Mordor, and with slightly more hair.

 Appearance 
    Gollum, as seen in the films  
In the Jackson adaptation of The Two Towers, Faramir describes him as ""having an ill-favored look."" He was also very thin and only had six teeth (in the The Hobbit saying 9), comparing him to Shelob; one of the Orcs describes him as ""rather like a spider himself, or perhaps like a starved frog."" Gollum's toughness is said to stem from his hobbit roots. Gollum hates light, and avoids it if possible. He is emaciated and gaunt, but possesses a vicious, wiry strength; Aragorn states, ""his malice gives him a strength hardly to be imagined."" In The Two Towers, Gollum's grip is described as ""soft, but horribly strong"" as Gollum wrestles with Sam Gamgee. He is also able to climb effortlessly straight down cliffs impossible to climb by Sam and Frodo, and can make long leaps. Additionally, he can run extremely fast, strangely on all fours. Gollum prefers to eat meat raw, and refuses to eat anything Elvish because it apparently burns him to the touch. Also, in Jackson's depiction, Gollum seems to be neutral, having no affiliation with Sauron (though he's still tortured by Sauron's minions and is still imprisoned.
His appearance was originally to be bigger and more menacing, like Smaug in The Hobbit trilogy, but were changed to make their ""characters"".[5]

Uruk-hai (for short, Uruks) were brutal warriors of Middle-earth, and the strongest Orcs, who dwelt in Mordor and Isengard.
In The Lord of the Rings, the term Uruk-hai refers chiefly to those bred in Isengard, and in one context are alternatively called Isengarders, while Uruks from Mordor are called Black Uruks or Uruks of Mordor.

Contents[show]
 History 
The Uruks first appeared out of Mordor, in TA 2475, when they assaulted and managed to conquer Ithilien and destroyed the city of Osgiliath. The Uruks in the service of Barad-dûr used the symbol of the red Eye of Sauron, which was also painted on their shields.
Uruk-hai were later bred by the Wizard Saruman the White late in the Third Age, by his dark arts in the pits of Isengard. In the War of the Ring, the Uruk-hai made up a large part of Saruman's army, together with the Dunlendings, man-enemies of Rohan. There are suggestions that the Uruk-hai were the result of crossbreeding orcs and men. There were other creatures in Saruman's armies, and under his command in the Shire, that appear to have been hybrids. ""Half-orcs"" were as tall as Men and are never described simply as orcs, as the Uruk-hai frequently are. Saruman's vast army of Uruk-hai fought against King Théoden of Rohan and his people at the Helm's Deep.

    Uruk warriors  
The Uruks of Saruman used an Elf-rune wrought in white metal on the front of their iron helms. It was clear this stood for Saruman, because their shields had a small white hand (the symbol of Saruman) centered on a black field. Aragorn commented that their gear was not in the manner of other orcs at all. Instead of the curved scimitar, they used short, broad-bladed swords. Their great bows were made of yew wood, of the same length and shape as those of men.
Saruman appeared to aid his orcs with his wizardry as well: when Aragorn, Gimli, and Legolas followed the party of Uruks who had kidnapped Merry and Pippin, Saruman's will caused weariness of the heart for the pursuers and lent speed to the orcs.[1] This was the group that slew Boromir, and was later annihilated by Éomer and the Riders of Rohan.[2][3]

 Etymology 
Uruk-hai was a Black Speech word that meant ""Orc-folk."" The name ""Uruk-hai"" has the element Uruk, a Black Speech word related to ""orc"" and to the (Valinórean) Quenya word urko (Ñoldorin Quenya: orko) of the same meaning. The element hai means ""folk,"" so ""Uruk-hai"" is ""Orc-folk."" A similar term is Olog-hai (""troll-folk""), used for a breed of especially strong and vicious trolls capable of surviving sunlight.
Christopher Tolkien describes ""uruks"" as an anglicization of ""Uruk-hai,"" and his father used the two terms interchangeably a number of times.

 Portrayal in adaptations 
 The Lord of the Rings film trilogy 
""Do you know how the Orcs first came to being? They were Elves once, taken by the dark powers, tortured and mutilated. A ruined and terrible form of life. And now, perfected. My fighting Uruk-hai.""
—Saruman    The Uruk-hai force assembled at the foot of the Orthanc  

In The Lord of the Rings movie trilogy by Peter Jackson, Saruman appeared to believe that the Uruks were his invention. In The Fellowship of the Ring, Gandalf mentioned Saruman breeding the Uruks to possess the traits of ""orcs and goblin men"" without the two races' weaknesses. However, the film-lore book The Lord of the Rings: Weapons and Warfare clears up this discrepancy by explaining that Saruman was in fact only replicating Sauron's method. Sauron's Uruks, seen in The Return of the King, have noticeably rougher features than Saruman's. Saruman's Uruk-hai are shown as being released from a kind of membrane in the mud deep under Isengard (special commentary on the DVD edition explained that they were trying to base the scene on an early description of Tolkien's that orcs ""worm their way out of the ground like maggots"").


""This is no rabble of mindless Orcs. These are the Uruk-hai, their armor thick and their shields broad...""
—Gimli to Théoden

 Weaponry and army composition 
    Uruk-hai in full armour in Peter Jackson's The Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers  
His Uruks army includes pikemen, swordsmen, crossbowmen, sappers, scouts, and berserkers. The berserkers are even larger and more vicious Uruks. They shave their heads and fill their helmets with human blood, so that when they put on the helmets the blood runs down their backs and its scent sends them into a killing frenzy. They carry double-bent swords. These swords were feared by their Rohirrim enemies for good reason. First, they had double spikes on the end (used for hamstringing or disemboweling horses). Second, the tremendous strength of the berserkers could easily take the head off of any human. Last, they had a keen cutting edge that could easily cut through the leather armor of the Rohirrim (for the massive swords were powerful enough to cut through even steel armor). The sappers were responsible for crewing the ballistae, handling the ladders and carrying Saruman's bombs.
The army additionally had many hundreds of pikemen and a smaller count of deadly crossbowmen. Normal Uruk infantry wielded swords and shields. These swords would maximize the brute strength of the Uruks, being able to cut off limbs and heads very easily.

    An Uruk Berserker  
They also sometimes use bladed shields with the White Hand painted on them, as seen in Amon Hen during Aragorn's fight against Lurtz. These were broad shields, made of durable iron that could defend well against incoming attacks and would provide an alternative weapon by using the bladed side, should the Uruk lose his other weapon. Scouts wear light, leather armor and have leather helmets with no crests or brims, and wield short swords, axes, daggers, and powerful bows of yew with a tremendous draw weight. Their armor is grey and is made up of large lames and has a groin guard. Underneath is a layer of chainmail that covers the torso, half the arm and a small fraction of the legs. They also wear arm armor but they have bare legs. For footwear they have puttees and sandals that are covered by foot and leg armor.
As the Isengard Uruk-hai were an army that was being rapidly grown, mass production of arms was required to equip them quickly. The metal weapons used by the Isengard uruks, as depicted in The Fellowship of the Ring, are made from steel melted in a foundry, cast in open molds, then forged, and finally finished by sharpening on grindstones. Armor and helmets are also seen being hammered and shaped en masse. Though the weapons and armor were competently crafted, the quality is depicted as relatively crude compared to the more finely honed weapons of the elves, men, and Dwarves. This lack of quality is not shown as hindering effectiveness.

 Middle-earth: Shadow of Mordor and Shadow of War 
Uruk-hai, or ""Uruks"" as they are termed in the games, appear in both Middle-earth: Shadow of Mordor and its sequel Shadow of War as the games' primary antagonists throughout the land of Mordor. A wide variety of Uruks are depicted, including a hierarchy of captains and warchiefs within Sauron's army. Some are also shown to be necromancers, wielding dark sorcery.
Their appearances in these games do not resemble their film depiction.

 Notable Uruk-hai 
Uglúk - One of Saruman's Uruk-hai who commanded the scouts that attacked the Fellowship of the Ring and captured Merry and Pippin. Uglúk later died fighting Éomer when his band was slain by Rohirrim.

Shagrat - Shagrat was a huge, tall and long-armed Uruk Captain in command of the tower of Cirith Ungol, which guarded a pass into Mordor. His company met another band of orcs coming from Minas Morgul and led by an old acquaintance of Shagrat, captain Gorbag. The two find Frodo and bring him to the tower. The two captains enter a heated argument over the hobbit's belongings and eventually a skirmish between their troops starts which ends with Shagrat killing his weakened rival. Shagrat later evades Sam and flees to Barad-dûr with Frodo's cloak, sword and Mithril shirt.
Gorbag was an Uruk captain from Minas Morgul who commanded an orc company. His company met Shagrat's orc garrison from the Tower of Cirith Ungol in Shelob's lair, where they found Frodo. Gorbag's greed overcame his loyalty to their master Sauron and he claimed ownership of Frodo's belongings, thus starting a skirmish between his Morgul Orcs and Shagrat's Uruk-hai. After sustaining a few injuries, the wounded Gorbag sneaked behind Shagrat with a spear, only to be killed by his rival. In the film adaptation, he is a crook-legged orc instead and gets killed by Sam.

Mauhúr  led an attack on the Rohirrim surrounding Uglúk's company, but failed to drive them off.

Lugdush - He was one of Saruman's Uruks, and appears to be a trusted subordinate of Uglúk. He was tasked with guarding the captive Merry and Pippin. He was presumably killed along the other orcs by the Riders of Rohan near Fangorn Forest.

 Non-canonical 
    Lurtz observing his strength after being born from the mud of Isengard  
Lurtz - Lurtz was a character created specifically for Peter Jackson's movie The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring. He is the first Uruk-hai bred in Isengard, and kills the first thing he sees, strangling the orc who oversaw his birth. As the first Uruk made, he is shown to be the strongest Uruk, and his skin appears a muddy brown instead of the other Uruk-hai's more reddish skin. Saruman places him in command of the ""Uruk-hai scouts"" and sends him along with a company of Uruks to find the Fellowship of the Ring. He kills Boromir with a bow, shooting him three times, and then violently duels with Aragorn, in which he loses his arm, is impaled by Aragorn's sword, and finally beheaded. He was portrayed by New Zealand actor Lawrence Makoare.

""Here was one with an air of high nobility such as Aragorn at times revealed, less high perhaps, yet also less incalculable and remote: one of the Kings of Men born into a later time, but touched with the wisdom and sadness of the Eldar. He knew now why Beregond spoke his name with love. He was a captain that men would follow, that he would follow, even under the shadow of the black wings.""
—Peregrin Took's first impression on Faramir[7]

Faramir was the second son of Denethor II and the younger brother of Boromir. He was the Captain of the Rangers of Ithilien and Captain of the White Tower upon his brother's death.
After the War of the Ring, Faramir became the first Prince of Ithilien and married Éowyn of Rohan.

 Biography 
 Early life 
    Finduilas, by Catherine Chmiel.  
Faramir was born in the year TA 2983 to Denethor II and Finduilas, daughter of Adrahil of Dol Amroth.[1] The following year, his grandfather Ecthelion II died and his father, Denethor, succeeded him as the Ruling Steward of Gondor.[8]
When Faramir was five years old, Finduilas died. Her death caused Denethor to become detached from his family. The relationship between Faramir and Boromir, who was five years elder of the brothers, grew much closer and greater in love. Despite the obvious way that Denethor favored Boromir over Faramir, there was no jealousy or rivalry between them. Boromir protected and helped him, and Faramir looked up to his older brother. Although the siblings were very similar in appearance with their dark hair and grey eyes, it was not so in personality. Boromir was defined to be the more daring one, as well as the more fearless and strong warrior. Faramir’s boldness was incorrectly judged less due to his gentle nature and love of lore and music.
It was this interest that formed a friendship between Faramir and Gandalf the Grey. The youngest son of Denethor learned of what he could from Gandalf’s wisdom and mentoring. Denethor did not approve of Faramir as the ""Wizard's pupil"", for he neither trusted nor liked the Istar.[7]
Faramir's leadership, skill-in-arms, and swift but hardy judgment proved to be handy on the battlefield. During the War of the Ring, he was the Captain of the Rangers of Ithilien, who often skirmished with the allies of Sauron in that province. Faramir valiantly defended Gondor from the Enemy, but did not enjoy fighting for war’s sake.

 War of the Ring 
 Defending Osgiliath 
    Faramir and his brother Boromir at the time of the Witch-king's assault on Osgiliath  
In June of 3018, Sauron's forces attacked Osgiliath, under the command of the Witch-king, whose presence caused the soldiers to draw back across the Anduin. When the last bridge was destroyed, in which Boromir’s and Faramir's companies remained, the two brothers, along with two others, swam to shore and managed to hold all of the west shores of the Anduin.[9]

 A fateful dream 
The night before the assault, Faramir had a prophetic dream of a voice speaking the following riddle:


‟Seek for the Sword that was broken:
In Imladris it dwells;
There shall be counsels taken
Stronger than Morgul-spells.
There shall be shown a token
That Doom is near at hand,
For Isildur's Bane shall waken,
And the Halfling forth shall stand”


—Faramir's dream[9]

It came to Faramir twice more and once to his brother, and the brothers told of their dream to Denethor, who only told them that Imladris was an Elvish name for Rivendell, home of Elrond. Although Faramir had wanted to go for Gondor’s sake and was originally chosen by the Council of Elders in Gondor, Boromir, with the urging of his father, stepped forward and claimed the right to the errand, deeming it to be dangerous and doubtful. The Gondorian traveled nearly four months to Rivendell, losing his horse in the process near Tharbad, and arrived just before the Council of Elrond.

    Faramir upon finding his brother's body in the Anduin  
On February 29, 3019 at midnight, Faramir, who was on guard duty on the western shore in Osgiliath, waded down to a boat floating down the Anduin River. To his grief, it contained the dead body of his brother, which was pierced with many wounds. In it lay his sword, broken, but there was no sign of the Great Horn, which he and his father had heard being blown far across the distance in the North three days prior.

 Discovering the One Ring 
    Faramir finds Frodo and Sam in Ithilien  
During a battle with Southrons, Faramir, who took over his brother's position as the Captain of the White Tower, encountered the Hobbits Frodo Baggins and Samwise Gamgee, recognizing them to be the Halflings his dream spoke of. After the skirmish, Faramir took the pair to Henneth Annûn and questioned them further.[3]
Through intelligent questioning and intuition, Faramir determined that Frodo was carrying some great evil weapon of the Dark Lord of the Enemy. At this point, he showed the crucial difference between him and his proud brother:


""But fear no more! I would not take this thing, if it lay by the highway. Not were Minas Tirith falling in ruin and I alone could save her, so, using the weapon of the Dark Lord for her good and my glory. No, I do not wish for such triumphs, Frodo son of Drogo.""
—Faramir[6]

Sam accidentally revealed Boromir's desire for the Enemy’s Ring, Isildur's Bane. Despite the hobbits’ fears, Faramir remained true to his vow that he would not take it even if it lay on the highway, for he was wise enough to realize that such a weapon could not be used for good. With this knowledge, he also realized the peril his brother had faced.[6]
On the very same night, Gollum was spotted fishing in the Forbidden Pool next to Henneth Annûn -- an act punishable by death. Faramir listened to Frodo’s pleas to spare Gollum’s life though, and after interrogating the creature he decided that Frodo and Sam would be free in the Lands of Gondor and Gollum under Frodo's protection. Giving them provisions, he sent them on their way to continue their quest. At their parting, Faramir warned Frodo of Gollum's treacherous nature and that the path Gollum had proposed (Cirith Ungol) had an evil reputation of old.[4]

 Siege of Gondor 
Faramir and his company retreated to Cair Andros, an island in the River Anduin that guarded the northern approaches to Minas Tirith. After noting that the sky was now covered in complete darkness, Faramir sent his company south to reinforce the garrison at Osgiliath while he and three others of his men rode to Minas Tirith directly. Along the way, they were pursued by the Nazgûl, riding fell beasts. The men, except Faramir, were unhorsed and it was the Captain, a master of both beasts and men, who was still horsed and rode back to aid the fallen. If Gandalf had not intervened, they would have surely perished.

    Faramir rebuked by his father Denethor  
Arriving at Minas Tirith, Faramir reported to Denethor and Gandalf of his encounter with Frodo and Sam. Denethor became angry that Faramir had not brought the ring to Gondor, wishing that he and his brother’s places were reversed, since Denethor believed that Boromir would bring the Enemy’s weapon to him.
Denethor sent his remaining son to hold Western Osgiliath against the hosts of the Enemy that outnumbered their own greatly. Although Faramir disagreed with his father’s strategy, he agreed to go.

Faramir: ""Then farewell! But if I should return, think better of me!""
Denethor: ""That depends on the manner of your return.""
—Faramir and Denethor's exchange of words[7]

The Witch-king overwhelmed the men of Gondor and won Osgiliath. Faramir drew back to the Causeway Forts, in which many of the men were wounded or killed. Faramir decided to stay with the rearguard in order to make sure that the retreat over Pelennor Fields would not turn into a disaster.
Faramir was gravely wounded by a poisonous arrow during the retreat. Fortunately, Gandalf and Faramir's uncle, Prince Imrahil of Dol Amroth, rode to the aid of Faramir and the troops with hosts of cavalry. Imrahil bore Faramir back to Denethor, telling him that his son had done great deeds.

    Faramir placed on the pyre at Denethor's command  
Regretting that he had thanklessly sent his son off in needless peril without his blessing, Denethor, after looking in the Palantir, believing that the Ring was captured and the end was near, ordered his servants to build a funeral pyre for him and his son, who was believed to be poisoned by the Witch-king’s dart. Despite the protests of the Hobbit, Pippin Took (serving the steward in payment of Boromir's death) that Faramir was still alive, Denethor continued with this madness and released him from his service.[10]
Horrified, Pippin went to alert Gandalf and Beregond, one of the Tower Guards. Beregond, who loved his captain enough to abandon his post and risk his life protecting him, stopped the servants from lighting the pyre. Pippin returned with Gandalf, who intervened by taking Faramir off the pyre as Faramir moaned out to his father in his dreams. Denethor took out a knife, trying to take Faramir back, but Beregond placed himself in front of Faramir. Seeing that he could not win, Denethor lit the pyre and laid himself down upon it, burning himself alive.[10]

 Recovery and last days of the Third Age 
    Healing Faramir, by Anke Eissmann  
Then, Faramir was laid in the Houses of Healing until Aragorn came and revived Faramir with athelas. It was not a poisoned dart of the Witch-king that wounded him in a state near death as it was with Snowmane, but the arrow of a Haradrim, along with Faramir’s weariness and grief concerning his constantly strained relationship with his father and the Black Breath of the Nazgul, who, under Sauron's orders, hunted Faramir ever since he had left Ithilien. When he awoke, Faramir immediately recognized Aragorn as his rightful King, therefore realizing that no proof was needed after all.[5]
Before Aragorn left to lead the soldiers to the Black gate, he commanded the Warden of the Houses of Healing to have Faramir and Éowyn to remain resting for at least ten days. After Éowyn demanded that the Warden take her to the Steward of the City to have her released so she could ride out in battle, Faramir, whose heart was moved with pity and pierced by her beauty, told Éowyn that he too, had to heed the advice of the Warden. He fulfilled her request to have her room look east to Mordor and asked her to talk with him at times.[5]
Faramir and Éowyn walked together in the gardens nearly every day, and he learned from Merry Brandybuck of Éowyn's despair of feeling trapped, waiting on the waning of Théoden, and of Aragorn's rejection of her love.[5]

    Faramir and Éowyn together looking towards Mordor  
On March 25, Faramir gave Éowyn a dark blue mantle sewn with silver stars that had once belonged to his mother, as they stood at the wall that looked towards Mordor. There, they saw a threatening darkness towering over and seeing this, Faramir told her of his dream of the Downfall of Númenor that the darkness threatening to overtake Middle-earth reminded him of the great wave that swallowed the land of Númenor. Somehow, to Faramir and the people of the city, a hope and joy welled in their hearts and he kissed Éowyn’s brow.[11]
Éowyn, however, still felt languished and unfulfilled. Several days after he gave her the mantle, Faramir told her that he understood that she desired to be lifted in greatness and out of the cage she had felt trapped in, and when Aragorn only gave her understanding and pity, instead of love (which she later realized was a shadow of love), she had wanted to die valiantly and gloriously in battle. He told her that though he had first pitied her, he now loved her. There, Éowyn’s grief was fully healed, and no longer did she desire glory or greatness and realized that she had come to love Faramir in return.[11]

 Later years 
Faramir briefly served as the Ruling Steward of Gondor, and began preparing the city for the King's arrival. On the day of the King’s official coronation on May 1st, Faramir surrendered his office, which was represented by the white rod of the Steward, kneeling as he did so. Aragorn however, gave the rod back, announcing that as long as his line would last, Faramir and his descendants would be Stewards of Gondor. After Faramir had asked the people of Gondor if they accepted Aragorn as their King (which they did), Faramir took the crown out and Aragorn was crowned King Elessar.
King Elessar appointed Faramir as the Prince of Ithilien, and Beregond to be the Captain of his guard, the White Company. As Prince of Ithilien, he and the Prince of Dol Amroth, Gondor's two highest-ranking nobles, became King Elessar's chief commanders. His duties also included acting as resident march-warden of Gondor's main eastward outpost, rehabilitating the lost territories, as well as clearing it of outlaws and orcs and cleansing Minas Morgul of evil remnants. Faramir also fulfilled the traditional role as Steward, acting as the King’s chief counselor as well as ruling Gondor in the King's absence.

    Family portrait, by Anke Eissmann  
After marrying Éowyn,[12] the two settled in Emyn Arnen, where they had at least one son (named Elboron). Elboron would succeed Faramir as Steward of Gondor, Prince of Ithilien, and Lord of Emyn Arnen, after Faramir's death in FO 82.[13]  Faramir lived to be 120 years old, due to the large percentage of pure Dúnedain ancestry he possessed as a member of the nobility of Gondor. One of his descendants was Barahir, who may have been the son of Elboron.[14][15]

 Etymology 
As with the other names of the Kings of Gondor and their heirs,[16] it is possible that the name Faramir is Quenya.

 Quotes 
""But fear no more! I would not take this thing, if it lay by the highway. Not were Minas Tirith falling in ruin and I alone could save her, so, using the weapon of the Dark Lord for her good and my glory. No, I do not wish for such triumphs, Frodo son of Drogo.""
—Faramir discusses the One Ring[6]

""For myself, I would see the White Tree in flower again in the courts of the kings, and the Silver Crown return, and Minas Tirith in peace: Minas Anor again as of old, full of light, high and fair, beautiful as a queen among other queens: not a mistress of many slaves, nay, not even a kind mistress of willing slaves.""
—Faramir, to Frodo[6]

""I am Faramir, Captain of Gondor, but there are no travellers in this land: only the servants of the Dark Tower, or of the White.""
—Faramir speaking to Frodo and Sam for the first time[3]

 Character significance 
     
According to Tolkien, Faramir was ""modest, fair-minded and scrupulously just, and very merciful"".[17] He mentioned once that he did not invent Faramir, though he liked the character very much.[18] As a soldier in World War I, Tolkien connected himself with Faramir, who only loved swords for ""which they defend"". Among the characters, Tolkien wrote, """"As far as any character is 'like me', it is Faramir"".[19]
It is for this reason that Tolkien bestowed his dream of a great wave (that recurred in his family) to Faramir. In one of his letters, he wrote, ""For when Faramir speaks of his private vision of the Great Wave, he speaks for me. That vision and dream has been ever with me—and has been inherited (as I only discovered recently) by one of my children, Michael"".[20]

 Portrayal in adaptations 
 Peter Jackson's film trilogy 
    Faramir in Osgiliath, prepared for the invading Orcs  
David Wenham portrays Faramir in Peter Jackson's film trilogy, appearing in The Two Towers and The Return of the King. His depiction in the films differs significantly from his appearance in the novels.
In The Two Towers, Faramir captures Frodo and Sam in Ithilien and holds them prisoner. After capturing and interrogating Gollum, Faramir discovers how Boromir died and that Frodo carries the One Ring. Wishing to impress his father Denethor, Faramir plans to take Frodo and the One Ring to Minas Tirith. It is only in Osgiliath, where he realizes the great evil of the Ring, that he lets Frodo, Sam and Gollum go. A flashback from the extended edition elaborates on Faramir's complex relationship with his father and brother.

    Faramir as he appears in The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King  
In The Return of the King, Faramir is still in command of Osgiliath when it is overrun by Mordor's armies. After Faramir retreats to Minas Tirith, an enraged Denethor orders him to lead a suicide mission to recapture Osgiliath; Denethor also reveals that he wishes that Faramir had died instead of Boromir. Plagued by guilt, Faramir takes on the mission but is grievously injured. 
After Faramir is dragged back to Minas Tirith unconscious, a deranged Denethor plans to burn himself and his younger son alive. Only Gandalf and Pippin's intervention saves Faramir's life. He recovers from his injuries and is present at Aragorn's coronation alongside Éowyn.
In the extended edition, it is revealed that he falls in love with Éowyn in the Houses of Healing while they are both recovering from their injuries.

 Criticism of movie appearance 
Many fans of the book criticize the changes Jackson made to Faramir's character, claiming that it seriously damages his persona; some have jokingly dubbed this interpretation ""Filmamir"" or ""Farfromthebookamir"", among other names [1].
Jackson's explanation is that he needed another adventure to delay Frodo and Sam, because the episode at Cirith Ungol was moved to the third movie, and so a new climax was needed. Another explanation often cited is that it was felt that for dramatic reasons it was necessary to show character development, which meant that Faramir had to go through some kind of struggle or difficult decision. Jackson also argued that it was necessary for Faramir to be tempted by the Ring because everyone else was tempted, and letting Faramir be immune would be inconsistent, at least in the eyes of a film audience, and would weaken the films' portrayal of the Ring, which was that of a seduction of normal men.
A number of fans however, remain unimpressed and unconvinced by Jackson's explanations, and have complained that Faramir was changed into a carbon copy of Boromir and have commented that Tolkien himself, who once likened himself to Faramir, would not have liked the way the film characterized him. Jackson counters that the important difference between Boromir and Faramir is retained: Boromir was completely incapable of resisting the temptation of the Ring. Faramir, realizing what his brother went through, what Frodo and Gollum must endure, and his own morals and personality in check, realizes the danger, and freely decides to let Frodo and company go.

     
Criticism was also leveled at the Rangers' treatment of Gollum. Fans bitterly pointed out that Faramir, whose gentle heart was easily moved by pity, would have never let his men treat a prisoner (no matter how evil) in any way but with kindness. In the book, Faramir refers the creature as Sméagol instead of Gollum, and told his men to ""treat him gently...but watch him"".
In the extended edition of The Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers, Jackson included a new flashback scene showing that Denethor has been neglecting him and favoring Boromir instead, so that Faramir wanted to please his father by bringing him the Ring. (The relationship is similarly strained in the books, but there his father's favoritism never seems to affect his decisions in Ithilien.) Overall, however, new Definitive Edition scenes with Faramir brought the character closer to the sympathetic treatment of the books (the line he is given regarding a fallen Southron belongs to Sam in the books, but is not out of keeping with Faramir's character).
Furthermore, instead of numerous captains and commanders taking charge of Gondor's defense, it is heavily implied throughout the films that when Boromir leaves all responsibility lies on Faramir to take command and defend Gondor, he does this to the best of his ability leading Gondorian forces through a prolonged battle that lasts from Midnight to the afternoon following, despite having legions of orcs pouring over the Anduin, thankfully his ability to lead a prolonged retreat that lasted the whole night, gave time for Gandalf the white to take over command of Minas Tirith and lead the oncoming siege.
David Wenham joked that he got the role because he and Sean Bean, who played Boromir, both had large noses. A minor change is that in the book, Faramir and his brother are dark-haired and lack beards, but in the films, they have fair hair and are slightly bearded.

In the RTS game The Lord of the Rings: The Battle for Middle-earth II, the hero Faramir is voiced by Paul Mercier.

Faramir's role in the War of the Ring is relatively minor in the game, as by the time the player reaches Minas Tirith Faramir has already been wounded and lies in a fever. His first prominent appearance is not until King Elessar's coronation. Afterwards, Aragorn charges the Steward and the Rangers of Ithilien with cleansing the evil of Minas Morgul and the Morgul Vale. Faramir leads the Rangers to establish several camps outside the dead city. Eventually he joins Damrod's team inside the walls Minas Morgul itself, working to combat the evil on the upper levels of the city.

Eärendil (Quenya; IPA: [e.aˈrendil]) was a great Half-elven mariner who voyaged to Valinor, entreated before the Valar on behalf of the Children of Iluvatar, and carried a star across the sky at the end of the First Age. His acts had been prophesied of among the Elves centuries beforehand.[4]
He was the father of Elros, the first King of Númenor, and of Elrond, the Lord of Rivendell and an important figure in the Second and Third age.
Eärendil was the first and seminal character of J.R.R. Tolkien's mythology; his name and purpose (as a character) were inspired by an excerpt Tolkien read out of the poem Crist. Eärendil's story is found in The Silmarillion, but he is invoked and referred to by many characters throughout The Lord of the Rings.

Contents[show]
 Biography 
Eärendil was the Half-elven son of Tuor and Princess Idril daughter of Turgon. He was born in FA 503 and was raised in Gondolin. When he was seven years old, he and his parents escaped the sacking of Gondolin, living afterwards in Arvernien by the mouth of Sirion.[3][5] The survivors of Gondolin and Doriath mingled at the Havens of Sirion. In FA 530,[2] Eärendil wedded Elwing daughter of King Dior Eluchil. Two years later, Elros and Elrond were born to them, and Eärendil began his voyage in search for Tuor and Idril, who had departed earlier over the Sea. With the aid of Círdan the Shipwright, Eärendil built a ship, Vingilótë.[6]

    Eärendil searches Tirion, by Ted Nasmith  
At this time, Elwing had in her possession the Silmaril that Beren had wrested from Morgoth. News of this came to the sons of Fëanor that were still living, and they attacked the people living in Arvernien, and slew most of them. Círdan and Gil-Galad sent ships to help them but were too late. But Elwing, rather than be captured, threw herself with the Silmaril into the sea, leaving her young sons behind.[6]
Hearing of the tragedy that had befallen Arvernien, Eärendil then sought after Valinor, and he and Elwing found their way there at last. Eärendil thus became the first of all mortals to set foot in Valinor. Eärendil then went before the Valar, and asked them for aid for Men and Elves in Middle-earth, to fight against Morgoth; and the Valar accepted his plea.[6]

    Eärendil slays Ancalagon, by Ted Nasmith  
Because Eärendil had undertaken this errand on behalf of Men and Elves, and not for his own sake, Manwë forbore to deal out the punishment of death that was due; and because both Eärendil and Elwing were descended from a union of Elves and Men, Manwë granted to them and their sons the gift to choose to which race they would be joined (a gift that was further passed to the children of Elrond, who became known as the Half-elven). Elwing chose to be one of the Elves. Eärendil would have rather been one of the Men; however, for the sake of his wife, he chose to be one of the Elves.[6]
The Valar, having listened to Eärendil's plea, went with a mighty host to Middle-earth, and overthrew Morgoth, and bound him. Eärendil took part in the battle, riding on Vingilot beside Thorondor and the Eagles. It was his blow that slew the great dragon Ancalagon and cast it down onto Thangorodrim, the event which, along with the sheer devastation caused by the War of Wrath, led to the Ruin of Beleriand.[6] Eärendil's fate was to eternally traverse the Great Ocean with the Silmaril that Beren and Luthien had wrested from Morgoth and guard the Sun and Moon.
In the Second Prophecy of Mandos, it is told that Eärendil will return from the sky for the love of the Sun and Moon that Melkor would blot out, and fight in the Dagor Dagorath.

 Later mentions 
The Hobbit of the Shire, Bilbo Baggins, wrote a ""Song of Eärendil"" which was sung in Rivendell, the house of Eärendil's son, Elrond.[7]

 Etymology 
    Earendil In Bronze, by TurnerMohan  
His father-name Eärendil is a Quenya name meaning ""Lover of the Sea"", from eä (""sea"") and the suffix -ndil (""devoted to, friend, lover"").[8][9] His mother-name was Ardamírë, ""Arda-jewel"", from the Quenya term mírë (""jewel"").[10]
The Adûnaic translation of Eärendil is Azrubêl.[10]
The first rendering of his name, before the making of his final tale in The Silmarillion, was Eärendel.

 Epithets 
Eärendil was given many epithets: Eärendil Halfelven, Eärendil the Mariner, Eärendil the Blessed, and Bright Eärendil.

 Name history 
Tolkien created the name based on Old English literature. Tolkien's himself states (Letters, 297) that the name is derived from Anglo-Saxon éarendel. He says that he was struck by the ""great beauty"" of the name as early as 1913, which he perceived as

entirely coherent with the normal style of A-S, but euphonic to a peculiar degree in that pleasing but not 'delectable' language.

There is a poem by Tolkien dated to 1914 entitled The Voyage of Eärendel the Evening Star (published in HoME 2 267 - 269). Tolkien was also aware of the name's Germanic cognates (Old Norse Aurvandill, Lombardic Auriwandalo), and the question why the Anglo-Saxon one rather than the Lombardic or Proto-Germanic form should be taken up in the mythology is alluded to in the Notion Club papers. The Old Norse together with the Anglo-Saxon evidence point to an astronomical myth, the name referring to a star, or a group of stars, and the Anglo-Saxon in particular points to the Morning Star as the herald of the rising Sun (in Crist Christianized to refer to John the Baptist).
Tolkien was particularly inspired by the lines:

Crist, éala éarendel engla beorhtast / ofer middangeard monnum sended
""Hail Earendel, brightest of angels, sent over Middle-earth to men.""

This was the inspiration not only for the role of Eärendil in Tolkien's work, but also for the term ""Middle-earth"" (translating Middangeard) for the inhabitable lands (c.f. Midgard).
The first line is paralleled by Frodo's exclamation in Cirith Ungol, Aiya Eärendil Elenion Ancalima! which is Quenya, and translates to ""Hail Eärendil, brightest of stars."" Frodo's exclamation was in reference to the 'Star-glass' he carried, which contained the light of Eärendil's star, the Silmaril. It also echoes Eönwë's exclamation who at the end of the First Age greeted Eärendil and his quest in Aman.

 Character 
Eärendil was once described as the following:

""Now this babe was of greatest beauty; his skin of a shining white and his eyes of a green surpassing that of the meadows in the southern lands -- greener than the emeralds of the raiment of Manwe;~ and the envy of Meglin was deep at his birth, but the joy of Turgon and all the people very great indeed""
—The Book of Lost Tales Part Two, ""The Fall of Gondolin""

 Concept and creation 
    Eärendil the Blessed  
In 1914, Tolkien wrote a poem ""The Voyage of Eärendil the Evening Star"" which was inspired by the ""Crist"" poem of Cynewulf. While studying at Oxford, Tolkien developed a constructed language that later became known as Quenya. Already around 1915 he had the idea that this language needed an internal history and was spoken by Elves whom his invented character Eärendil meets during his journeys. The next step in the creation of the underlying mythology was the Lay of Eärendil, a work composed of several poems that describes the mariner Eärendil and his voyages and how his ship is turned into a star. The mysterious land of Valinor and its Two Trees of gold and silver were first described in this cycle.
Tolkien's legend of Eärendil has elements resembling the medieval Celtic Immram legends, and also the Christian legend of St. Brendan the Navigator.
Humphrey Carpenter in his biography of Tolkien remarked that Eärendil ""was in fact the beginning of Tolkien's own mythology"". In Tolkien and the Great War, John Garth gives an extensive interpretation of Tolkien's 1914 poem, inferring many parallels in Eärendil and his flight.[11]

""Old Tom Bombadil is a merry fellow! Bright Blue his jacket is, and his boots are yellow!""
—Tom Bombadil

Tom Bombadil was an enigmatic figure that lived throughout the history of Arda who dwelt in the valley of the river Withywindle, east of the Shire. A mysterious being, Tom lived in the depths of the Old Forest, close to the Barrow Downs. His lands were not particularly extensive, but within his domain his power over virtually everything in it was extraordinary. Tom was a paradoxical creature, one moment defeating ancient forces with hardly an effort, the next capering and singing nonsensical songs. He lived with his wife Goldberry, ""Daughter of the River,"" far from any other settlement. Although seemingly benevolent, he took no open stance against the Dark Lords.

 Biography 
 Origin 
""Eldest, that's what I am... Tom remembers the first raindrop and the first acorn... He knew the dark under the stars when it was fearless - before the Dark Lord came from Outside.""
—Tom Bombadil (The Lord of the Rings)

The origin and nature of Tom Bombadil are unknown; however, he claimed already existed before the Dark Lord came to Arda[1], signifying he may have been alive even before the coming of the Valar (it is unclear whether he refers to Melkor's first or second entry into the world.). In any case, Tom is insinuated to have been the first living creature to inhabit Arda.

 First & Second Ages 
Tom would eventually ""leave"" where he came from and arrived in Middle-earth, where he began his journey through the region to explore it while wandering,  having witnessed the emergence of the forests and the rain. While his role and nature in the first and second ages is unknown, but he must have witnessed most of the major events and battles. He also witnessed the reducing of the great forests that covered all Middle-earth, and perhaps of his powers.[2] The level of his interactions with the outside world is also unclear; however, he perhaps became a folkloric figure in the traditions and legends of Elves, Dwarves and Men.[3] As a result, he came to be known by many names during his pilgrimage: the elves called as Iarwain Ben-adar (""Oldest and Fatherless"" in Sindarin), while he was known as Orald to men and Forn to the dwarves.

    Tom and Goldberry, by Mareishon  
At the end of his wanderings, Tom focused his exploration only on Eriador, making him the first to reside in the west even before the Elves moved there and the tides were folded. In this period, his journey down the Withywindle to the Brandywine river, several of the valley's mysterious residents, including the River-spirit Goldberry (also known as the ""River-woman's daughter""), the malevolent tree-spirit Old Man Willow and the Badger-folk, attempted to capture Bombadil for their own ends, but quail at the power of Tom's voice, which defeated their enchantments and commands them to return to their natural existence. Ultimately, Bombadil was captured and marries Goldberry when she pulled Tom by his beard under the water-lilies out of mischief, but he ordered her to let him free. The next day he came to the River-woman and asked Goldberry to be his wife, and the creatures of the Old Forest (the badger-folk and other animals) attended their wedding.[4][5]

 Third Age 
""But I had forgotten Bombadil, if indeed this is still the same that walked the woods and hills long ago, and even then was older than the old. That was not then his name. Iarwain Ben-adar we called him, oldest and fatherless. But many another name he has since been given by other folk: Forn by the Dwarves, Orald by Northern Men, and other names beside. He is a strange creature...""
—Elrond, The Fellowship of the Ring

    Tom Bombadil, by the Brothers Hildebrandt  
It is not known when Tom settled into his domain outside the Old Forest, but of course he was already living there when the Third Age began, seeing the rise (and fall) of the Realm of Angmar and its wars that led Barrow-downs being inhabited by evil spirits called Barrow-wights. He also saw the arrival of the Hobbits in the region that would become the Shire, which led him occasionally to interact with the little folk, mostly in Buckland. He eventually was named Tom Bombadil by the Bucklanders, which would become the name he adopted. Perhaps it was because of his contact with them that he had his cheerful and whimsical attitude.
A tale says that Tom is challenged by various river-residents on his journey down the Withywindle to the Brandywine river where hobbits live at Haysend, including birds, otters and hobbits, but charms them all with his voice, ending his journey at the farm of Farmer Maggot, where he drinks ale and dances with the family. At the end, the charmed birds and otters work together to bring Bombadil's boat home.[6]
He had also ventured into Bree and met Barliman Butterbur, the proprietor of The Prancing Pony.

 War of the Ring 
    Old Man Willow is tamed  
In 3018, Frodo and his company had a chance meeting with Bombadil in the Old Forest after a nearly disastrous encounter with Old Man Willow. Frodo, who had fled from the tree looking for help, enlisted Bombadil, who had been out gathering water lilies. Bombadil went immediately with Frodo to the tree and commanded it to release its prisoners, Merry and Pippin, which it immediately did. He then invited Frodo and his companions to his home, where the Hobbits had an almost dreamlike stay, feasting and making merry with Tom. In this state, Frodo rather inadvertently told Tom all about the Ring and his quest, and when Tom asked to inspect the Ring, Frodo, without question and without any of the reluctance that tended to accompany giving the Ring to another, allowed him to. Tom then put the Ring on his finger, yet not only did he not disappear, but the Ring appeared to have no effect on him at all. After making the Ring itself vanish with a sleight-of-hand trick, he returned it to Frodo, who, slightly suspicious that it had not made Tom vanish, put it on to make sure it was the genuine Ring. Tom surprised him yet again by revealing that he could see Frodo even with the Ring on, and told Frodo to remove it, stating that his hand was fairer without it.
After two days resting and feasting at Tom's home, the Hobbits set out again, only to be captured the next day by Wights on the Barrow-downs. Fortunately, Tom once again came to their rescue, dispersing the Wights and breaking open their tomb.[1] After this, he escorted the Hobbits to the borders of his land and left them there.
The peril of the hobbits was not over; an attack on their lives was carried out, and their ponies were set loose. The ponies apparently remembered the care they were given in the house of Tom Bombadil, and returned to stay beside Tom's own pony, Fatty Lumpkin. He returned them to Barliman Butterbur, the proprietor of The Prancing Pony. Since he had paid eighteen pence as compensation for the loss, he was now the owner of five fine ponies.[7]
Over a month later, Tom became a topic of discussion at the Council of Elrond. There, Elrond, who had apparently met Tom in times long past, reminisced about him briefly before the question was put before the Council of whether or not to give the Ring to Tom, as it appeared as though Tom may have had power over even the Ring within his lands. However, Gandalf quickly dismissed the idea, saying that rather than Tom having power over the Ring, the Ring simply had no power over Tom. He was immune to its influence, but he could not alter it. There is however evidence of Tom's ability to affect the rings power over others,

Yavanna (Quenya; IPA: [jaˈvanna] - ""Giver of Fruits"") was of the Ainur and Valar, and one of the Aratar who was responsible for the growth of all the fruits and growing things of Arda. She was also called Kementári (Quenya; IPA: ""Queen of the Earth""), Ivon (Sindarin; IPA: ""Giver of Fruits""). She resided in the Pastures of Yavanna, in the south of Valinor.[1]
She was the wife of Aulë, older sister of Vána [2], and kin to Melian.[3]

Contents[show]
 Biography 
Beginning in the Years of the Lamps during the Spring of Arda, she planted and caused to grow the first growing things of the world (trees and plants), which she had long prepared. At first, just as every other thing in the world that the Valar nurtured and cared for, these things prospered and thrived for a time. Melkor, however, had his own plans and they involved taking the world from his brethren and ruling it for himself. From his great fortress of Utumno in the far north, he sent forth his poisons into the veins of the world blighting the Spring of Arda. Then the things of Yavanna fell sick and rotted and soon after Melkor assaulted and destroyed the Two Lamps, breaking the world.
Afterwards, the Valar relocated to the continent of Aman where they created the Two Trees - the only light in the whole world at that time. Middle-earth was left in darkness, and the living things that survived were put into a great sleep by Yavanna until the rise of the Sun and the Moon many thousands of years later.
After Eru allowed Aulë's creations, the Dwarves, to survive, Yavanna feared that they would cut down all the trees in Middle-earth. Eru answered her plea by creating the Ents to protect and shepherd the trees.[2][4]
In the Song of the Ainur, Yavanna sang of branches of great trees that would receive the rain of Manwë and Ulmo, and some trees sang to Ilúvatar. This is said to be the conception of the Shepherds of the Trees. Her thought also met with Manwe's, setting the arrival of the Great Eagles.[4]
In the beginning of days, Yavanna planted the first seeds of Arda and watched over the Olvar and all growing things. As Morgoth was corrupting her beloved creatures, she contended with him and supported all the plans against him. After his expulsion from Arda she planted the seeds that she had long devised and life came to Middle-earth during the Spring of Arda, although in the beginning no flowers bloomed. When the Two Lamps were destroyed much of the life on Middle-earth slumbered in the Sleep of Yavanna[5] that lasted until the rising of the Moon and the Sun.
After the destruction of the Two Lamps the Valar withdrew to Aman and created Valinor. Upon the green mound of Ezellohar, Yavanna sat and sang while the other Valar sat and listened. Her song, with the aid of the tears of Nienna brought forth the Two Trees, her greatest creation, which gave light to the land. However, Yavanna did not forsake the Outer Lands; at times she would come there and heal the hurts of Morgoth and urged the other Valar to wage war on him before the Awakening of the Elves.
After Eru allowed Aulë's creations, the Dwarves, to survive, Yavanna feared that they would cut down all the trees in Middle-earth. Aulë, in reply, told her that even Elves and Men, the true Children of Ilúvatar would have need of her trees as well. Yavanna lamented to Manwë, questioning whether anything she had made would be free from the dominion of others. Manwë brought her concerns before Ilúvatar in prayer, and Eru did indeed have pity upon Yavanna: He answered her plea by creating the Ents to protect the trees.
When the Elves built Tirion upon Tol Eressëa Yavanna fashioned the tree Galathilion, a lesser image of Telperion, for the court beneath the Mindon.[6]
After the destruction of the Two Trees Yavanna examined their remains and told the other Valar that if she could use the light of the Silmarils she could heal them. This light she was denied by the will of Fëanor.[7] Doing what she and Nienna could, they managed to bring forth one silver flower from Telperion and one golden fruit from Laurelin. She gave these to her husband Aulë, who fashioned vessels for them and thus created the Moon and the Sun.[8]
For the Men who had stood with the Valar in the War of Wrath the land of Andor was raised by Ossë, established by Aulë, and enriched by Yavanna. When the Edain came to this island they created the realm of Númenor.[9] In the later centuries, when the Valar decided to send emissaries to the mortal lands, Yavanna begged the Maia Curumo to take her servant, Aiwendil, with him.[10]

 Etymology 
In Quenya, Yavanna means ""Giver of Fruits"", from yáve (""fruit"")[11] and anna (""gift"").[12] Kementári, her epithet, means ""Queen of the Earth"", from kemen (""the Earth"")[13] and tari (""Queen"").[14]
Her name in Sindarin is Ivon, meaning ""Giver of Fruits"". It is only attested in the compound Ivonwin(""Maidens of Yavanna"").[15] The month Ivanneth may have been named after Yavanna.[16]

 Earlier names 
Palúrien was an earlier name for Yavanna. It means ""Lady of the Wide Earth.""[17]

 Trivia 
  Yavanna could possibly be related to Aragorn, as she is said to  be kin of Melian, who was Aragorn's distant ancestor. Yavanna's possible relation to Melian could result in her relation to many other characters, such as Elros, Elrond, and Arwen.

  She is ranked fourth among the Aratar (eight most powerful of the Valar) and second among the Valier (ladies of the Valar).
  Instead of Yavanna, in a few other versions, it was her sister Vána that made Laurelin bear its last fruit.
  Yavanna shares similarities with the classical goddesses: Demeter, associated with crop growth and fertility, and Gaia, also known as ""Mother Earth"".

Varda (Quenya; IPA: [ˈvarda] - ""Sublime"" or ""Lofty"") was an Ainu, and one of the Aratar and a Vala responsible for the outlining of the stars in the heavens above Arda. She was also known as Elbereth (Sindarin; IPA: ""Queen of the Stars""), Tintallë (""The Kindler""), or Gilthoniel, and was the spouse of Manwë, with whom she lived in Ilmarin on the summit of Taniquetil in Aman.

 Biography 
    Varda by LordM  
Varda was the most beautiful of all the Valar, and her beauty was said to be beyond the description of Men and Elves, for her face radiates the light of Eru Ilúvatar. Unsurprisingly, the province over which she ruled was light, to the extent where it was said that ""in light is her power and her joy"".[1]
Even before Melkor first began to create his discord, Varda knew his mind well, and rejected him because of it, and was always his enemy from that moment on. As a result of this, Melkor also hated Varda the most out of the Valar, and feared her more than all others whom Eru had created.
Varda came to Arda with her husband, Manwë, and the other Valar in the beginning of days. She aided Manwë in the rule of Arda and the watching of Middle-earth. She made the stars, filled the Lamps of the Valar with light, collected the dew of the Two Trees in her Wells, fashioned the newer stars and constellations in preparation for the Awakening of the Elves, hallowed the Silmarils, established the courses of the Moon and Sun, and set the Star of Eärendil in the sky.
Because of her creation of the stars, the Elves of Middle-earth revere and love her the most out of the Valar. They even gave her the name of ""Elbereth"", invoke her in times where they require aid, and sing her praises whenever the stars rise. It was also said that when Manwë sits beside her upon their throne on Taniquetil, she was able to hear more clearly than any other ears, the prayers and laments of those in need from the furthest east even unto the west.

    Varda by DymondStarr  
At times, she would answer the prayers of not only Elves, but also those of other races. For example, during the War of the Ring, she aided Sam through the Phial of Galadriel (which contained the Light of Eärendil) during his struggle against Shelob.

 Maiar of Varda 
 Ilmarë, the handmaiden of Varda and Queen of the Maiar alongside Eonwë, Manwë's herald.
 Olorin (Gandalf), the second-in-command (and later leader) of the wizards sent to Middle-Earth to combat Sauron.

Etymology
Varda means sublime or lofty in Quenya.
Elentári means queen of the stars in Quenya.
Gilthoniel means kindler of the stars in Sindarin.
She is probably best known by her Sindarin name, Elbereth Gilthoniel, uttered by Frodo at Weathertop to drive away the Ringwraiths, and at other instances later.

Inspiration
 Literary connections 
The Valar are divine beings below a greater, more ultimate Creator: Eru Ilúvatar. Hence, some equate the Valar of Middle-earth with saints and angels, and Varda (as the most beloved and most prayed-to Valar) may therefore be an equivalent of the Virgin Mary in Tolkien's own Catholic faith.
With his creation and inclusion of the Valar into his words, Tolkien also paid homage to Greek mythology, particularly the Greek Pantheon: each and everyone of the Valar had a specific realm within the world that was at his or her command, much as the Greek Gods in ancient myths. Tolkien wanted to create a mythology for his world, and the Greek model fit the bill perfectly.
With this in mind, Manwë, King of the Valar, is most akin to Zeus (the King of the Greek Gods). In the same manner, Varda, as the wife of Manwë as well as the Queen of the Valar, is the equivalent of Hera (the wife of Zeus and Queen of the Greek Gods). Due to her being the most beautiful and lovable of the Valar, she was also seen to be most akin to Aphrodite (the Greek Goddess of Love and Beauty).

 Biography 
    The encounter of Beren and Luthien by Marinela Mexi  
 Early life in Dorthonion 
Beren was one of the Edain (men), the son of Barahir and Emeldir the man-hearted. He was a man of the royal House of Bëor of Dorthonion, and the most accomplished hero and adventurer of the First Age. The battle of the Dagor Bragollach befell during his youth, bringing about the ruin of his kingdom. The young Beren lived with his father and eleven loyal followers in the highlands of Dorthonion, and the thirteen of them performed many acts of bravery, to the great frustration of Morgoth, the Dark Lord of Angband. After the ruin of the Outlaws of Dorthonion and the death of his father, Beren lived alone in Dorthonion off the land and came to know the many birds and beasts that lived there, and they helped him when he needed it. During this time, he hunted nothing and ate no meat and only killed the creatures of Morgoth that roamed the country. He learned not to fear death only captivity and bondage; however, things began to grow more difficult for him in Dorthonion for Morgoth put an even greater price on his head and he was forced from the land of his birth by Sauron and Draugluin. He crossed into Doriath, through the forests of Dungortheb, where he saw and fell in love with Lúthien, princess of the Sindar and daughter of Thingol and Melian.[5]

 The Quest for the Silmaril 
    Beren and Luthien in the Court of Thingol by DonatoArts  
Thingol haughtily refused to give Lúthien's hand in marriage. He said that he would allow the marriage to take place only if Beren brought back a Silmaril from the Iron Crown of Morgoth. The task was intended to be impossible, but Beren and Lúthien, with the aid of Finrod of Nargothrond and Huan the Great Hound (both of whom died protecting Beren), braved many perils (even besting Sauron, then Morgoth's most powerful lieutenant) and captured a Silmaril. However, as they escaped from Angband, the great wolf Carcharoth, whom Morgoth had personally bred, awoke. Beren held out the Silmaril, hoping that its radiance would avert the beast, but he was mistaken. Carcharoth bit off his hand swallowed it and the Silmaril (thus Beren was called Erchamion, One-hand), and proceeded to run rampant through Doriath. Lúthien and the unconscious Beren were rescued by the Eagles of Manwë. When he presented himself to Thingol, he demonstrated to him that he had obtained, then lost the Silmaril at the cost of one of his hands; he was then given the name Camlost, Empty-handed. Beren participated in the hunting of Carcharoth, where the beast was slain and the Silmaril recovered; the quest was accomplished, but in the process Beren was mortally wounded.[5]

 Second life 
    Beren lies dying in Lúthien's arms, by Gustavo Malek  
Lúthien's love for Beren was so strong that, upon hearing of his death, she lay down and died. Her soul went to the Halls of Mandos, where she managed to charm Mandos into granting her a wish. Both she and Beren were miraculously restored to life, but both of them would live as mortals and die the death of Men, and go beyond the walls of Arda to a place unknown. Thus Beren and Lúthien lived again, and dwelt on Tol Galen in the middle of the river Adurant in Ossiriand. There they stayed apart from other mortals; Beren was involved with the events of the First Age only one further time, when he waylaid a group of dwarves who had destroyed Doriath and stolen the Nauglamír (and the Silmaril with it).[5]
Lúthien bore Beren a son, named Dior, Thingol's heir, considered to be one of the fairest beings to ever live, for in him flowed the blood of men, of elves, and of the Ainur. Through his descendants, the blood of Beren and of Lúthien was preserved among the Eldar and the Edain.[5]

 Legacy 
Beren's deeds inspired all the peoples opposing Morgoth to unite themselves into a greater force to vanquish his power resulting in the valiant but doomed Union of Maedhros.[6] His romance and love for Lúthien Tinúviel and what he was willing to do to ensure it helped foster greater respect for men amongst the elves. He was also the first to mix the blood of elves and men with each other and this bloodline continued, siring the Númenórean nobility[7] and the Dúnedain alike on up to Aragorn II Elessar of the Reunited Kingdom.

 Etymology 
In Noldorin, Beren means ""bold"".[8]
His epithets, Erchamion (""one-handed"") and Camlost (""empty-handed""), both contain the Sindarin word cam (""hand"").[9]

 Weapons 
As an outlaw in Dorthonion, Beren used the sword Dagmor and a bow to aid him in his journey.[4] Later, he carried the knife Angrist, which he used to cut the Silmaril from Morgoth's crown.

""Things will go as they will; and there is no need to hurry to meet them.""
—Treebeard

Treebeard, also known as Fangorn, was the oldest of the Ents left in Middle-earth, an ancient tree-like being who was a ""shepherd of trees"". He had a very tall and stiff-limbed appearance, with bark-like skin and leafy hair.
In Chapter 5 of The Two Towers, Gandalf calls Treebeard ""...the oldest living thing that still walks beneath the Sun upon this Middle-earth."" In The Return of the King, Chapter 6, ""Many Partings"", Celeborn addresses Treebeard as ""Eldest.""

 History 
""Hrum, now, well, I am an Ent, or that's what they call me. Yes, Ent is the word. The Ent, I am, you might say, in your manner of speaking. Fangorn is my name according to some, Treebeard others make it. Treebeard will do.""
—The Lord of the Rings, The Two Towers, Book III, Chapter IV: ""Treebeard

 Before the Third Age 
Treebeard was believed to be the oldest Ent who ever lived. He was so old that he remembered the time of Elves teaching the trees to speak, recalling how they wanted to talk to everything. In the time when Middle-earth was merely a giant forest, Treebeard roamed the land, presumably with his love, Fimbrethil. But after the loss of the Entwives, he and the remaining Ents dwelt in the Forest of Fangorn, isolating themselves from the outside world.

 Third Age and War of the Ring 
""I do not like worrying about the future. I am not altogether on anybody's side, because nobody is altogether on my side, if you understand me: nobody cares for the woods as I care for them, not even Elves nowadays.""
—The Lord of the Rings: Treebeard

    Treebeard grabs Pippin.  
With the arrival of the Istari in the year TA 1000 of the Third Age, Saruman came to Fangorn and befriended Treebeard, and would often visit him. The two would talk, discussing various subjects, with Saruman gathering information about the forest itself, and in particular its intertwining paths.[1]
As the years passed and with no Entings due to the loss of the Entwives, the number of Ents fell. Some Ents in their old age became still and silent, almost becoming tree like as they slumbered. Treebeard, Finglas, Fladrif, Quickbeam and around fifty remained, some younger, some older. When Sauron's shadow began to spread across the land once more, Treebeard and the Ents remained in Fangorn, continuing to tend the trees, and taking no part in the affairs of Men, Elves and Wizards. However, they were brought into the war when Meriadoc Brandybuck and Peregrin Took escaped from Saruman's Orcs, became lost in Fangorn Forest and befriended Treebeard. Upon learning that Saruman was cutting down the forest to power his war effort, an angry Treebeard called all the ents together for an Entmoot. After three days of deliberation, they decided to attack Isengard, in an event known as the Last March of the Ents.[1]
Leading the attack, Treebeard helped to bring down Isengard's walls and utterly destroy them, save the tower of Orthanc and Saruman himself who sat in his tower with his manservant Grima Wormtongue. The Ents also broke the dam wall which had starved the once green and beautiful Wizards Vale of all its water, flooding Saruman's pits, mines, and machines of war.[2] Once Isengard was cleansed, Treebeard remained to guard over Saruman, but was ultimately unable to keep him, due to the power of Saruman's voice and the fact that Treebeard could not bear to lock any living thing up.[3]

 After the War of the Ring and Beyond 
After Aragorn was crowned king, he promised Treebeard that the Ents could prosper again and spread to new lands with the threat of Mordor gone, and renew their search for the Entwives.  However, Treebeard sadly lamented that forests may spread once more, but the Ents would not, predicting that the few remaining Ents would remain in Fangorn forest until they slowly dwindled in number.  However, he still held some hope for finding the Entwives, as he asked Merry and Pippin to watch for them near the Shire, and to bring word if they were to find them.[3]
Treebeard's ultimate fate is not known. While he aged very slowly and was extremely long-lived, he was not immortal.[citation needed]","

    Gilraen's Grave in Rivendell  
Gilraen was the wife of Arathorn II and mother of Aragorn, the future King Elessar of the Reunited Kingdom.

Contents[show]
 Biography 
Gilraen was born in TA 2907. Her father was Dírhael and her mother was Ivorwen. She was also known as ""Gilraen the Fair"". Gilraen married Arathorn son of Arador in TA 2929. Her father Dírhael was opposed to the match because he felt Gilraen was too young to marry and because he had a sense of foreboding that Arathorn would not live long. But Ivorwen counseled her husband to acquiesce, saying ""If these two wed now, hope may be born for our people; but if they delay, it will not come while this age lasts"".[1]
One year later, Arathorn II became Chieftain of the Dúnedain when his father was killed by Hill-trolls. Gilraen gave birth to Aragorn on March 1, 2931. In TA 2933, Arathorn was slain by an Orc arrow. Gilraen took her two-year-old son Aragorn to Rivendell where Elrond accepted the boy as a foster-son and gave him the name Estel, meaning ""Hope"".

    Aragorn visiting his mother's grave  
Gilraen and Aragorn lived together at Rivendell until TA 2951, when Aragorn turned twenty and was told of his heritage by Elrond. At that time also Aragorn met Elrond's daughter Arwen and fell in love with her. Gilraen noticed a change in her son and questioned him about it. She warned Aragorn that Elrond would not easily consent to a marriage between his only daughter and a mortal Man. Gilraen feared that the line of Isildur would end, and she told Aragorn that it was his fate to wander in the Wild. She said no more to him of her fears and Aragorn left Rivendell to face many perils and hardships.
Aragorn and Arwen plighted their troth in TA 2980. A few years later, Gilraen left Rivendell and went to live alone near her people in Eriador. She did not often see her son for he continued to journey throughout Middle-earth. When Aragorn came to visit his mother, she foretold her coming death.
Gilraen died before the next spring in TA 3007. Her son Aragorn fulfilled the Rangers' lifelong goal of restoring the Kingdom of the Dúnedain when he became King of the Reunited Kingdom on May 1, 3019.[2]

 Etymology 
Gilraen means 'Wandering star' in Sindarin.[3]

 Portrayal in adaptations 
 Peter Jackson's The Fellowship of the Ring 
Gilraen was memorialized in Rivendell as a statue.

 Fan films 
Gilraen was a primary character in the fan-made film Born of Hope, and was played by Beth Aynsley.

Ingwë was a Vanyar Elf, the King of the Vanyar and the High King of the Elves.

 Biography 
    Ingwë  
Ingwë was the leader of the first Kindred of Elves of the Vanyar tribe, and the uncle of Finwë's wife Indis. His name means ""first one, Chief"" in Quenya. He was perhaps one of the first twelve elves who awoke in Cuiviénen with Imin, who was the first to awake. He became one of the three elves, with Elwë and Finwë, of the first embassy to Aman.
Ingwë became the first of the Vanyar to travel to Valinor with Oromë. Loving its beauty and bliss, he returned to his people and urged them to undertake a journey to Aman. He and his kin were fascinated with the Valar, and they decided not to return to Middle-earth. They stayed and made Ingwë their king. The Mindon Eldaliéva in Tirion was built in honor of him.
Ingwë was reckoned as High King of all the Eldalië, the Elves of the Great Journey, and because of this he is called Ingwë Ingweron; the ""Chief of the Chieftains"". He lived in Taniquetil, ruling from beneath Manwë High King of Arda.
Ingwë never set foot on Middle-earth after he began living in Taniquetil. When the Vanyar took up arms in the War of Wrath and followed The Host of Valinor, Ingwë did not join them.[1][2][3]

 Early versions of the Legendarium 
Inwë was an early name for Ingwë and was described as King of all the Eldar of Kôr or King of the Fairies or Lord of the Teleri before it was changed to the Vanyar, who led them to lands of Men or the world. The Gnomes called him Inwithiel. He was also called Isil or Isil Inwë. He had a son named Ingil.[4][5][6]

""But still, she was there, who was there before Sauron, and before the first stone of Barad-dûr; and she served none but herself, drinking the blood of Elves and Men, bloated and grown fat with endless brooding on her feasts, weaving webs of shadow; for all living things were her food, and her vomit darkness.""
—The Two Towers, ""Shelob's Lair""

Shelob was a great Spider and the greatest offspring of Ungoliant, the primordial spider. In the Third Age she lived in Mordor and was known to feed indiscriminately, preying on the inhabitants. She was encountered by Frodo Baggins and Samwise Gamgee in their quest to destroy the One Ring.

Contents[show]
Biography
Early life
Shelob's early history is completely unknown, save for the assumption that she was born in the Ered Gorgoroth and that she was the ""last child"" of Ungoliant. By the Second Age, she often feasted on her own children, and that at some point after fleeing from Beleriand, yet long before Sauron took the land of Mordor for himself she spun a dark lair in the Ephel Duath (Mountains of Shadow), near Cirith Ungol in the passes above Minas Morgul. For hundreds of years, she resided there making a labyrinth of webs within a network of caves to better trap her prey, which included all creatures great and small. She feasted primarily on those who wandered into her webs, though if a particularly juicy morsel was available, she would silently pursue and kill it.

Third Age
Sauron was aware of Shelob's presence in the mountains and allowed her to dwell there, for she made an excellent, if incidental, guard for the passage of Cirith Ungol. Sauron was known to be somewhat fond of her, and in a rare show of humor, was even known to refer to her as his cat. Sauron would sometimes give her food in the form of prisoners for which he had no more use, or servants who had displeased him. Reports of the massacre made by Shelob would be carried back to Barad-dur to further please the Dark Lord's humor. She would also sometimes eat Orcs that manned the tower of Cirith Ungol. However, as she was a more effective guard for the pass than they, Sauron never made any serious attempt to stop her (though Orcs would occasionally try to barricade her lair with stones).
At one point after being set free from Mordor, Gollum stumbled into her lair while attempting to escape the barren country. She caught him, but he survived the encounter by promising to bring her tastier meats than he.[3] Orcs of Cirith Ungol had seen him on several occasions and believed that he was too thin and wiry for Shelob to bother eating.[4]
Gollum would attempt later to fulfill this promise by leading Frodo and Sam into her lair and abandoning them. His hope was that once Shelob finished eating the two hobbits, she would throw away the Ring with the other parts of the hobbits that she could not eat, allowing Gollum to retrieve it. The two hobbits eventually happened upon a passageway that was too choked with Shelob's dark cobwebs to proceed, but as fortune would have it, Frodo's sword Sting, being of Elvish make, was able to slice through them. Using the Phial of Galadriel, they managed to at first fend her off. The light of Earendil's Star shone from the Phial, caused unbearable stabbing pain to Shelob's darkened senses, but she returned to attack Frodo poisoning him with her stinger in a surprise attack just as they had reached the exit of the cave on the Mordor side.
Sam then assaulted the creature using Sting in order to rescue his master, who lay poisoned after Shelob's surprise attack. In a pitched battle, Sam managed to stab one of her great eyes, injuring her leg, and pierce her great belly, the most grievous wound. Sam was lucky indeed as Shelob caused this wound herself, when she tried to stab him with the venomous stinger in the underside of her abdomen. None had ever wounded her so badly before.[5]
It is not known if Shelob recovered from the battle, or if she succumbed to her wounds, as it was said her fate would remain unknown to the people of Middle-earth. She is last mentioned when Sam put on the One Ring, and heard Shelob ""bubbling"" in her misery far away, as his sense of hearing was vastly improved by wearing the Ring.

 Character 
As a spawn of Ungoliant, Shelob would accurately be classified as part spider, part demon (to an unknown extent), though of a spider form. Like most spiders, Shelob had spindly legs, multiple eyes, and venomous chelicerae. She usually immobilized her prey with her paralyzing sting that enabled her to feed on her victims at her leisure, but could also crush her prey to death by swiftly dropping on them. Her head was cris-crossed with scars and she had a number of missing eyes. The Orcs comment she usually would paralyze her victims and trap them in webs, keeping them alive for some time before killing them.

 Portrayal in adaptations 
 Ralph Bakshi's film 
Gollum indirectly mentions Shelob near the end of Ralph Bakshi's 1978 film, saying that ""she might help us..."", but she does not appear.

 The Lord of the Rings film trilogy 
Unlike in the books, Shelob makes her first appearance in Peter Jackson's The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King, rather than The Two Towers, because (as explained) if she had appeared in The Two Towers, there would be very little for Frodo and Sam to encounter in the final film. In this adaptation, Shelob appears as a CGI animated creature, roughly eight feet in length and seventeen feet across.

 Middle-earth: Shadow of War 
Spoiler warning: Plot and/or ending details follow.    Shelob as she appears in Middle-earth: Shadow of War  
Shelob, in Middle-earth: Shadow of War, is visible in human form in the wraith-world. In the game, she has Celebrimbor's ring for quite some time while giving Talion visions about the fate of Minas Ithil (Minas Morgul) and the Ringwraiths. It is also seen in the game that Shelob was working with Sauron during the period he was posing as Annatar, and was implied to be his lover before he betrayed her. The mobile version of Shadow of War classifies Shelob as a Maia, though J.R.R. Tolkien never specified her exact nature.  Spoilers end here.  
 The Lord of the Rings Online
    Shelob in The Lord of the Rings Online  
Shelob is known to Elves as ""Ungwetári"" and Lord Celeborn had hunted her down in the early years of the Third Age, to no avail. Shelob has a mental link to her children and after being stabbed by Samwise she summons all of her children to her side for nourishment and protection. Places formerly infested with spiders such as Mirkwood become empty as whole nests of them travel south to the call of their mother. Shelob herself is depicted as much larger than in the movie or other giant spiders, which are encountered in the game on numerous occasions. Shelob herself is the last boss in the main raid of the Minas Morgul expansion.

Goldberry, the ""River-daughter"", was the wife of Tom Bombadil in the Old Forest at the edge of Buckland.
Contents[show]
 Biography 
 Origin 
Little is known of the origin and nature of Goldberry except that it is speculated that she is a river-spirit of the river Withywindle, given she's River-woman's daughter.

 Before Third Age 
    The River daughter.  
When Tom Bombadil ventured into the Eriador region, several of the valley's mysterious residents, including Goldberry, attempted to capture Bombadil for their own ends, but quail at the power of Tom's voice, which defeated their enchantments and commands them to return to their natural existence. However, according to a tale, Goldberry was in the Withywindle when she pulled Tom by his beard under the water-lilies out of mischief, but he ordered her to let him free. The next day he came to the River-woman and asked Goldberry to be his wife, and the creatures of the Old Forest (the badger-folk and other animals) attended their wedding.[1]

 Third Age 
    Goldberry in her home, by Hildebrandt  
Apparently, Goldberry lived in a little house by the river Withywindle in the Old Forest, together with her lovely husband Tom Bombadil, since the beginning of the Third Age. Like Tom, she also interacted occasionally with Hobbits, specifically the Bucklanders, who lived in the region what would become the Shire.

 War of the Ring 
In 3018 Tom Bombadil travelled to the lower reaches of the Withywindle to gather white water-lilies for her, and it was while returning from a lily-gathering expedition that he discovered Frodo and his companions, and rescued them from Old Man Willow. Goldberry seems to have used her lilies to recreate her original home in the river: when Tom brought the Hobbits back to his house, they found a seated Goldberry surrounded by water-lilies floating in pots of earthenware.[2]
Goldberry hosted the Hobbits and they found her to be as mysterious as Tom, but were grateful for her kindness to them and were enchanted by her presence. She then explained a little about Tom to the group and then asked them to clean up to have dinner with them. The next day, while washing the house, she interrupted Bombadil when he told the Hobbits of their origin and called them to eat. The next morning she said goodbye to Frodo and the others when they left for Barrow-downs.[3]
After rescuing the Hobbits from the Barrow-downs, Tom Bombadil selected a brooch with blue stones from the hoard of the Barrow-wights to give Goldberry.[4]

 Appearance 
Goldberry had long, yellow hair and her voice was beautiful, ""as young and as ancient as spring, like the song of a glad water flowing down into the night from a bright morning in the hills."" When the Hobbits first saw her she was wearing a gown ""green as young reeds, shot with silver like beads of dew; and her belt was of gold, shaped like a chain of flag-lilies set with the pale-blue eyes of forget-me-nots."" She was standing amid wide vessels of green and brown earthenware in which ""white water-lilies were floating, so that she seemed to be enthroned in the midst of a pool.

 Nature 
    Goldberry in the Old Forest surrounded by a pool of water-lilies, by Wouter  
Although Goldberry's origins are uncertain, Bombadil clearly identifies her as having been found by him in the river and her title ""River-woman's daughter"" strongly suggests that she is not a mortal human being, but rather a spirit of the river Withywindle in the Old Forest. This is similar to the many named river spirits of traditional English folklore such as Jenny Greenteeth or Peg Powler of the River Tees,[5] (though Goldberry is a noticeably gentler figure), or to the naiads of the Greeks. Otherwise, she and Bombadil are enigmas in Legendarium, not fitting easily into any of his definitions of sentient beings in his world.
One frequently proposed explanation is that she is a (minor) Maia associated with the element of water and in some way with the river Withywindle in particular, though that is by no means the only possible answer John D. Rateliff suggested that, at least in terms of Tolkien's early mythology, she should be seen as one of the wide category of fays, spirits, and elementals (including the Maia): ""Thus Melian is a 'fay', (as, in all probability, are Goldberry and Bombadil; the one a nymph, the other a genius loci).[6]

 Inspiration 
In The Letters of J. R. R. Tolkien, Tolkien describes Goldberry as the seasonal changes in nature, and Tom Bombadil as the nature spirit of the English countryside.[7]
Tolkien based his mythic personages on Eurasian myth and cosmology: The Great Goddess who is mother of all things was, before Time existed, the element of water, undifferentiated. Time begins when her first offspring is born, and, according to Tom Bombadil, he is the Eldest, or first-born. The River is the local manifestation of the primal Great Goddess, and Goldberry is her daughter, the spirit of all local waters existing in Time, alive and embodied. Both Tom and Goldberry are primal spirits of nature, he of the land and its produce and she of the water.[8] In early Eurasian myth, the element of water is feminine and the land or earth is masculine; therefore, Goldberry represents the female principle of life while Tom represents the male.[9] Together as husband and wife they are the totality of primal Nature, endlessly proceeding in an eternal circle from season to season forever.

 Portrayal in adaptations 
 Radio 
Goldberry is heard in The Lord of the Rings radio series and is possibly voiced by Nicolette Bernard. In the Tales from the Perilous Realm radio series, she is voiced by Sorcha Cusack.

 Video games 
She appears in the The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring and is voiced by Kath Soucie.

 Short film 
Goldberry has recently been portrayed in a short film produced by fans at TheOneRing.net.

 Trading Card Game 
In The Lord of the Rings Trading Card Game, Goldberry is portrayed by Amanda Niel.

Meneldil was the third King of Gondor.

Contents[show]
 Biography 
Meneldil was born in Númenor a year before its fall.[1] Son and fourth child of Anárion, he was said to be the last child born in Númenor before its downfall. He had three older siblings, apparently all sisters. 
After the War of the Last Alliance in which his father Anárion was slain, for a few years Meneldil was groomed by his uncle Isildur to rule Gondor, since Isildur and his sons intended to go to the North to rule Arnor.  According to Unfinished Tales, Meneldil was farsighted and well-pleased at the planned departure of Isildur, hoping that affairs in the North would keep them occupied.  Meneldil became the third King of Gondor in TA 2 after the death of his uncle Isildur in the Disaster at the Gladden Fields.  Meneldil was the first King of Gondor who ruled independently from the High Kingdom of the Dúnedain, Arnor.
It is uncertain whether Meneldil was King by right, as young cousin Valandil would have had the better claim as High King of Gondor and Arnor, but no claim by Valandil was ever made. It was in any case unlikely that Meneldil would give up his right to rule to a much younger cousin he had never seen. In any case, the people of Gondor did not resist Meneldil's claim to the throne, and King Valandil and his heirs made no serious attempt to regain control over Gondor until after Anárion's line had failed. In effect, Meneldil thus severed Gondor from Arnor, but the title of High King remained with the northern line.
Meneldil died in TA 158 after one hundred fifty six years of rule and two hundred eighty one years of life and was succeeded by his son Cemendur.[2]

 Etymology 
Meneldil was a Quenya word that meant Heaven-lover or Lover of the Heavens.[3]

Cemendur was the fourth King of Gondor.

Contents[show]
 Biography 
Cemendur succeeded his father Meneldil to the throne of Gondor in TA 158. Very little is known of his reign, only that it was a peaceful one like most all of the very early Kings of Gondor. He died in TA 238 after a rule of eighty years and two hundred eighty years of life and was succeeded by his son Eärendil.[2]

 Other versions of the legendarium 
A much earlier Cemendur (b. SA 575) was a descendant of Elros, and the son of Axantur. He had two children: a daughter Írildë, and a son Hallatan. Hallatan was the father of Hallacar, the husband of Tar-Ancalimë.[3]


 Etymology 
Cemendur is a Quenya word meaning 'Earth-lord'.[4]

Anardil was the sixth King of Gondor.

Contents[show]
 Biography 
Anardil was born in TA 136.[1] He ascended to the throne after the death of his father Eärendil in TA 324. No notable events were recorded for his reign, except that he was the last king to dwell in Osgiliath during the summer, as his son rebuilt and expanded Minas Anor. Anardil died in TA 411 aged 275 after a rule of eighty-seven years and was succeeded by his son Ostoher.[2]

 Etymology 
The name Anardil is a Quenyan word that meant ""devoted to the sun"" or ""friend of the sun"". It is made from the words anar, meaning ""sun"", and -dil (another form of the more common ending -ndil), meaning ""devoted"" or ""friend"". A much earlier Anardil was the birth-name of Tar-Aldarion.[citation needed]","

Ostoher was the son and successor of King Anardil of Gondor and he became the seventh King upon Anardil's death in TA 411.

Contents[show]
 Biography 
He moved his summer residence from the capital city of Osgiliath to the fortress of Minas Anor in TA 420. During this time he rebuilt and greatly added to it and over time it would become a city as well as a fortress, until after the Great Plague of 1636 when it became the capital of Gondor as Minas Tirith, over twelve-hundred years later.
In the last two years of his reign the Easterlings started attacks on Gondor. Due to his advanced age, he sent his son Tarostar (later known as Rómendacil I) to meet the Easterling threat and Tarostar defeated[3] the Easterlings into eventual submission.[4]
Ostoher died in TA 492 at the age of two-hundred seventy after a rule of eighty-one years and was succeeded by Tarostar.[2]

 Etymology 
Ostoher was a Quenya word that meant 'fortress-lord'.[5]

Rómendacil I was the eighth King of Gondor.

Contents[show]
 Biography 
Rómendacil was born with the name Tarostar the son of King Ostoher. When the Easterlings invaded in TA 490, the young Tarostar as crown-prince was charged with fighting them as his father was too old. He succeeded his father upon his death in TA 492. He rode against them in many battles and finally defeated them by TA 500. After the victory he renamed himself to Rómendacil, meaning ""East-victor"".
It was he that created the office of the Steward of Gondor and they would be Men of wisdom and learning that would serve as high councilors to the king.[3]  This act set the stage for a line of men, known as the House of Húrin that would later be the rulers of Gondor when the line of the kings failed in TA 2050.
The peace on Gondor's frontiers was not to last forever: forty years later in TA 541 the Easterlings invaded once again, and he rode to meet them in battle but was slain.
He was succeeded by his son Turambar.[1]

 Etymology 
Rómendacil was a Quenya word that meant 'East-victor', and his birth name Tarostar was also a Quenyan word that meant 'Royal-fortress'.[4]

""Upon it sat a shape, black-mantled, huge and threatening. A crown of steel he bore, but between rim and robe naught was there to see, save only a deadly gleam of eyes: the Lord of the Nazgûl... now he was come again, bringing ruin, turning hope to despair, and victory to death. A great black mace he wielded. ""
—The Return of the King, ""The Battle of the Pelennor Fields""

The Witch-king of Angmar was the leader of the Nazgûl (Ringwraiths), and Sauron's second-in-command during the Second and Third Ages. Once a king of Men, possibly of Númenórean heritage, he was corrupted by one of the nine Rings of Power that had been given to the lords of men, becoming a wraith in the service of Sauron.  
After the first defeat of Sauron in the War of the Last Alliance, the chief Nazgûl lay low for over a millennium but eventually reappeared to found the evil realm of Angmar, where he gained the epithet ""Witch-king"" and ruled for more than six hundred years until the Númenórean line of kings of Arnor was brought to ruin.
He returned to Mordor to facilitate Sauron's return to power, then took the Gondorian citadel of Minas Ithil, refortified it as the fearful Minas Morgul, and there snuffed out the line of kings of Gondor too. He led Sauron's armies in the War of the Ring, stabbed Frodo Baggins on Weathertop during the first months of Frodo's venture out of the Shire to Rivendell, and at the Battle of the Pelennor Fields he besieged and broke the gates of Minas Tirith and killed King Théoden of Rohan.
Chief lieutenant and greatest servant to the Dark Lord across over four thousand years of Middle-earth history, he was a king, a mighty warrior and an undying sorceror of incomparable fear and dread. In his hour of triumph at the Pelennor however he was killed by the hobbit Meriadoc Brandybuck and Éowyn, niece of Théoden, at the end of the War of the Ring.

 Biography 
 The Second Age: the Nine Rings and the advent of the Nazgûl 
    The Witch-king when he was a mere human  
The forging of the Rings of Power began some 1500 years into the Second Age. In SA 1600 Sauron forged and donned the One Ring for the first time, and in SA 1693 began the War of the Elves and Sauron during which he recovered the Nine Rings and gave them to mighty lords and rulers of Men. The mightiest of all of them was likely a king and powerful sorceror, but little is known of his and their earthly lives except that over the coming centuries they prospered as their power, wealth and mortal lifespans extended under the corrupting influence of their rings. The only certainty is that eventually he and all the others slipped into the shadow-world and became Nazgûl – Ringwraiths – enslaved wholly to the will of Sauron.
The first sighting of the Nazgûl in Middle-earth was reported in SA 2251. For the next 1200 years the greatest among them, the Lord of the Nazgûl, would serve Sauron as the commander of his army. He fought in the Age's climactic war against the Last Alliance of Elves and Men between SA 3434 and SA 3441, when the Dark Lord was eventually defeated and the One Ring cut from him. With Sauron's spirit and power dissipated the nine Nazgûl were no longer able to maintain their physical presence and they too disappeared – at least temporarily – from Middle-earth.

 The Third Age: return and the arising of Angmar 
    The Witch-king's true undead appearance in the first Lord of the Rings film  
One thousand years into the Third Age, Sauron took form in the world again and founded, incognito, the fortress of Dol Guldur in southern Mirkwood in TA 1050. This signalled the return of the Nine to Middle-earth. Their leader, re-empowered, would set about enacting his master's long vengeance upon the Dúnedain kingdoms of Men, ruled by the descendants of the Faithful of Númenor who had (unlike Sauron) escaped its destruction and who subsequently brought him low with the Last Alliance.
By now the Dúnedain realm of Arnor, northern sister-kingdom to the southerly Gondor, had already become split into three following a civil war. It was into this febrile situation that the Lord of the Nazgûl reappeared in TA 1300 and began to fulfil Sauron's plan to bring down the North-Kingdom altogether. Adjacent to its lands he founded the dark domain of Angmar – where, from his capital of Carn Dûm, he began his campaign of open war with the three divided successor-states (Arthedain, Rhudaur, and Cardolan) of the former Arnor. It was after several conflicts with the Dúnedain of the North that they labelled this new threat's Nazgûl sorceror-chieftain with the title of ""Witch-king, Lord of Angmar"".

 The Witch-king's conquest of the North 
In TA 1356, the ""Witch-king"" invaded Rhudaur and replaced the Dúnadan king of the land with a hill-chief allied to Angmar. King Argeleb of Arthedain was killed trying to defend Rhudaur against Angmar. In TA 1409 the troops of the Witch-king assaulted the fortress of Amon Sûl (Weathertop) and burned the tower, during which conflict King Arveleg of Arthedain was killed. The Witch-king and his Rhudaur allies then invaded and destroyed the kingdom of Cardolan.
Now, the only resistance against the Witch-king's forces was the western kingdom of Arthedain. They invaded Arthedain and came close to destroying it, but King Araphor with the help of the elves of Lindon and Rivendell managed to defeat the invading forces.

    The Witch-king in his throne of Angmar  
An uneasy peace descended, but the undead Witch-king could continue his war for hundreds of years. In TA 1636, he sent evil wights to the Barrow-downs in Cardolan in order to prevent the rebirth of that kingdom. The Witch-king claimed ultimate victory in the north in TA 1974, when his forces captured Fornost Erain, the capital of Arthedain. With its fall, the final vestige of the old north-kingdom collapsed, and although Arvedui Last-King attempted to escape he was drowned in the Icebay of Forochel and the last remnants of the lost realm of Arnor were extinguished.
The Witch-king gladly took his seat of power in the newly conquered Fornost. But his glory did not last long, for the next year an army of Gondor under their general – and heir to their throne – Eärnur landed at the Elven harbours of the Grey Havens. Too late to save their north-kindred, they were nonetheless joined by the Elves of Lindon and the remnant of the northern Dúnedain and they marched on the Witch-king.[2]

 The Battle of Fornost 
Eärnur's host did not meet the Witch-king at Fornost Erain itself, but on the plains west of it toward Lake Evendim, near the site of the ancient capital of the kings of Arnor, Annúminas. The combat would though forever be known as the Battle of Fornost. Crucially, the cavalry of Gondor rode north into the Hills of Evendim to wait in ambush; as the main part of the army of Gondor met the enemy in battle, the cavalry emerged from the hills to strike the rear of the army of Angmar. This served as the turning point in the battle, and allowed the Dúnedain to gain the advantage.
Realizing that his forces were all but completely crushed, the Witch-king attempted to flee eastward – but an Elven army from Rivendell led by Glorfindel came up out of the south and blocked his escape, destroying what was left of his crumbling army. The Witch-king revealed himself in person and challenged Eärnur. As the Gondorian general attempted to attack, however, his horse was overwhelmed with fear of the Nazgûl-lord and bucked. The Witch-king, taunting Eärnur, fled the battlefield once and for all. When Eärnur attempted to follow, Glorfindel stopped him with a warning that would become prophetic in the future:

""Do not pursue him! He will not return to these lands. Far off yet is his doom, and not by the hand of man shall he fall.""

The Witch-king, beaten, yet having successfully brought down the northern Dúnedain kingdoms, fled the North. Angmar was left leaderless and soon collapsed.

 Return to Mordor and the rise of Minas Morgul 
    Minas Morgul, the final seat of the Witch-king  
Despite the rout, the Witch-king had fulfilled his mission to destroy the successor kingdoms and royal line of Númenor in Eriador, and so now he returned to Mordor after centuries in the north. Although Sauron was still hiding in Dol Guldur (disguised as ""the Necromancer""), the Nazgûl rallied back around their chief. Together, the nine Ringwraiths laboured to rebuild their master's power in Mordor, gathering huge Orcish hordes about themselves. In the year TA 2000 they came out of Mordor and began attacking Gondor, which was recovered from the Great Plague but devastated by the Wainriders. In TA 2002 they captured the Gondorian citadel Minas Ithil, and took the place for their own. It became known as Minas Morgul – the ""Tower of Sorcery"" – and remained a place of great evil for centuries thereafter.
In TA 2043, King Eärnil II of Gondor passed away and his son Eärnur, the Witch-king's old foe, inherited the throne. Upon his coronation, the Nazgûl-lord challenged his enemy to single combat, but Eärnur refused. However, seven years later in TA 2050 the Lord of Morgul again challenged him – and this time Eärnur accepted. The Gondorian monarch rode out of Minas Tirith to meet the Witch-king in combat at Minas Morgul. He entered the dread city's gates... and was never seen again. Thus ended the reign of the Gondorian kings and began the rule of the Stewards of Gondor. In TA 2063 the Watchful Peace began when Sauron fled Dol Guldur to avoid the investigations of Gandalf and hid in the East, and the Nazgûl remained quiet in Minas Morgul for the next 400 years.
In TA 2460, the Watchful Peace ended when Sauron, still identified only as the Necromancer, returned with increased strength to Dol Guldur, and in TA 2475 the Lord of Minas Morgul led hordes of Orcs and Haradrim against Gondor's capital Osgiliath and seized its eastern half. The city was ruined, and the great stone bridge linking the east and west banks of the River Anduin was destroyed, dealing a devastating blow to the morale of Gondor.

    The Witch-king at Barad-dûr, by John Howe  In TA 2941, after Gandalf finally confirmed that it truly was Sauron in disguise, the White Council belatedly moved to expel the Necromancer from Dol Guldur. Sauron however simply withdrew to his old stronghold of Mordor, openly declared himself once more in TA 2951 and began the reconstruction of the Barad-dûr. He began preparations to find his One Ring and sent three Ringwraiths to reoccupy Dol Guldur. And in TA 3018, with the capture and torture of Gollum, the Dark Lord learned where the land of the Hobbits lay. Unfortunately, Gollum had lied, and the Ringwraiths went to Saruman, who refused to tell them the location of the land of the Halflings. The Lord of the Nazgûl however chanced upon Grima Wormtongue in Rohan, who, for fear of his life, told where the Shire was. Sauron opened the gates of Minas Morgul and sent forth the Nine disguised as Black Riders to fetch his Ring.
With an attack on Osgiliath that was in fact a ruse, the Nazgûl and army of Orcs were able to cross the river and ride west.

 The War of the Ring 
The chief Nazgûl and the other eight rode swiftly from Mordor to the lands of the Shire. They continued to search for the ""Baggins"" Gollum had told of until they tracked the name to Buckland. The Nine Riders raided Buckland but could not find the Ring.
The Wraith-lord led four others of his kind to Weathertop – the ruined watchtower he had destroyed and burned some 1600 years earlier as Witch-king of Angmar – where they discovered Frodo, Aragorn, and the other hobbits. The Nazgûl attacked the party and their Lord wounded Frodo with a Morgul-knife. Though they were driven off by Aragorn, Frodo's wound threatened to turn him into a wraith like the Nazgûl. Elrond Half-Elven sent Glorfindel to guide Frodo to Rivendell, where Elrond could heal his wound. In a race to Rivendell, Glorfindel lured the Ringwraiths into the Bruinen. Here, Elrond released a great flood, with Gandalf giving the waves of the torrent the form of horses. This flood destroyed the physical forms of the Ringwraiths, killed their horses, and sent the Wraiths back to their master in Mordor, buying the Fellowship time to plan an attack.
With their return to Mordor, Sauron bestowed upon the Nazgûl great winged creatures as their new mounts. The Dark Lord used the lesser eight Nazgûl for reconnaissance work and as the occasional shock troop. Their leader, however, returned to Minas Morgul and resumed the role of commander of Sauron's forces. He then began battles to capture Osgiliath, finally issuing from Morgul Vale with a great host. However, at the bridge over Morgulduin he paused, feeling the Ring nearby; until Frodo touched the Phial of Galadriel, turning aside his enemy's thought.

 Siege of Gondor 
The final Battle of Osgiliath was fought on March 13, 3019 against Faramir's rangers. Faramir's forces could not hold the Orc hordes under the control of Gothmog. Faramir pulled his forces back to Minas Tirith assailed by flying Nazgûl, losing many in the retreat. A second time he went forth, and from that assault only Faramir returned to Minas Tirith, gravely wounded, in Gandalf's arms. With Gondor's defeat at Osgiliath, nothing stood in the way of Sauron's ambitions of destroying Minas Tirith and the Free People's hopes.

    The Lord of the Nazgûl during the Battle of the Pelennor Fields  
On March 14, Orcs, Haradrim, and Easterling forces numbering over 200,000 marched on the gates of Minas Tirith. Sauron had imparted his Black Captain with newfound strength; he appeared on a black horse, his presence casting a shadow of utter paralysis and fear upon defender and foe. Crying incantations in ""some forgotten tongue"", he enhanced the power of the mighty battering-ram Grond and weakened the already damaged gate of the city. The great ram broke open the gate, and the Lord of the Nazgûl rode in.
The defenders inside fled, terror-stricken by his dark presence. However, his entrance was halted by Gandalf the White, the only one able to withstand his power. There was a duel of words between them, and the Nazgûl-king doffed his hood revealing a crown on empty air, mocking Gandalf as ""old fool"" and bidding him die. Threateningly he drew his blade, which blazed of its own accord. Gandalf held firm, ready to do battle – but before they could clash the horns of Rohan sounded, signalling the belated arrival of aid to Minas Tirith. The Ringwraith then withdrew to order the forces of Mordor's defence against this new threat.

 Downfall 
The Lord of Morgul mounted his Fellbeast and rallied his troops against the furious charge of the Rohirrim. The army of Rohan was slowed, the initial charge blunted by their encounter with the Mûmakil, allowing the hosts of Mordor to reorganize. The Morgul-lord took this opportunity to strike down King Théoden while his troops were in confusion. Flying on the back of his fellbeast, he drove down upon the king. The advancing Rohirrim horses panicked as his beast attacked. Théoden's horse, Snowmane, became frightened, was struck by a black dart and fell upon its master, crushing him.
As the Nazgûl hovered over Théoden on his fellbeast, Éowyn and the hobbit Merry stood in his way.
Éowyn: Be gone, foul dwimmerlaik, lord of carrion! Leave the dead in peace!Nazgûl: Come not between the Nazgûl and his prey! Or he will not slay thee in thy turn. He will bear thee away to the houses of lamentation, beyond all darkness, where thy flesh shall be devoured, and thy shriveled mind be left naked to the Lidless Eye.Éowyn: Do what you will, but I will hinder it, if I may.Nazgûl: Hinder me? Thou fool. No living man may hinder me!Éowyn: But no living man am I! You look upon a woman. Éowyn I am, Eomund's daughter. You stand between me and my lord and kin. Be gone, if you be not deathless! For living or dark undead, I will smite you, if you touch him.

    The Witch-king's last moments  Éowyn slew his fellbeast with a single stroke of her sword, severing its neck. The Wraith-king arose, and giving a cry of hatred he shattered her shield and broke her left arm with a single blow of his mace. But as he towered over her, preparing to deliver the final blow, Merry stabbed his Númenorean sword from behind into the sinew of his knee – one of the few weapons that could have penetrated his defences. While the Lord of the Nazgûl was distracted, Éowyn drove her sword where the head of the wraith would have been, slaying him.
The prophecy made by Glorfindel at the Battle of Fornost so many centuries before had thus come to pass. For not by the hand of [a] man had he failed, but by those of a hobbit and a woman. Now, with his death, the tide of the battle had changed, and ultimately the outcome of the War.

 Aftermath 

Gandalf: [Sauron] studies the signs: the Sword that robbed him of his treasure remade; the winds of fortune turning in our favour, and the defeat unlooked-for of his first assault; the fall of his great Captain. His doubt will be growing, even as we speak here. His Eye is now straining towards us, blind almost to all else that is moving. So we must keep it.
Only a few days later, during the final council of war before the assault on the Black Gate, Gandalf predicted that the defeat of the chief Nazgûl, Sauron's single most powerful servant, not to mention the loss of the Battle of the Pelennor itself, was one of several factors that would undermine Sauron's confidence in the superiority of his forces and make him more likely to throw his entire remaining strength at whatever force of Gondorians and Rohirrim challenged him – thus giving Frodo and Sam their one slender chance to pass unhindered through Mordor and convey the One Ring to Mount Doom.
This counsel proved correct, and no more than ten days later, Sauron himself was finally defeated when the Ring was unmade in the Cracks of Doom. The remaining Ringwraiths perished in the cataclysmic eruption of the mountain. [3][4][5]

 Powers and abilities 
As a Nazgûl, the Witch-king had a wide arsenal of powers. He was surrounded by an aura of fear, enough to make trained soldiers run in terror. Besides the common Black Breath, any weapon that struck the Nazgûl-lord would be destroyed (a fate shared by Meriadoc Brandybuck's and Éowyn's swords), and its bearer would be poisoned. This was so severe that it was worse than a blow from his mace.
The Witch-king – as the title suggests – was also a feared sorcerer, having powers over the physical world, breaking Frodo's sword with just a move of his hand and weakening the Gates of Minas Tirith allowing the battering ram Grond to break them. The spell he used to weaken it also caused it to explode in a flash of lightning. He could also light objects on fire. He was stronger at night time. His power fluctuated greatly over his existence, as his powers were bound up with Sauron's own; the more powerful Sauron became, the more powerful the Nazgûl became.

 Roots in mythology 
An undead ""witch-king"" named Þráinn appears in Hrómundar saga Gripssonar, a work of Norse mythology. A ""witch-king"" also appears in Greek mythology, Aeëtes of Kolkhis, who more resembles the Witch-king of Angmar. The former, however, was more likely an inspiration for Tolkien, as he fancied and studied northern mythologies much more than southern mythologies (Greek, Roman, etc.).

 Speculation on name 
The Lord of the Nazgûl's true name is never given, and therefore he is known only by a host of epithets.
Properly, Witch-king is the title/description applied to the chief Ringwraith solely for the middle part of the Third Age, by those in the North of Middle-earth during his years as dread sorcerous ruler of Angmar. The phrase Witch-king of Angmar, in full, is only used by Tolkien once – in Appendix B to The Lord of the Rings, in the entry for the year 1409 of the Third Age.
Beforehand, and again afterwards following his return south to Mordor, he was more commonly known as simply the Lord of the Nazgûl and versions such as Nazgûl-lord, Wraith-king, etc.; and, after his taking of Minas Ithil, as variants on the Lord of (Minas) Morgul. Other honorifics such as the Black Captain are applied to his role as leader of the forces of Morgul during the siege of Minas Tirith.
The perhaps more distinctive moniker Witch-king (or Witch King) is however used frequently on merchandise and other supplementary materials derived from the Lord of the Rings film trilogy, contributing to its higher profile in the present day – including the title of this page.
At the Battle of the Pelennor Fields, Éowyn challenges him with the words: ""Begone, foul dwimmerlaik, lord of carrion! Leave the dead in peace!"" It is supposed that the word dwimmerlaik is formed from the Old English words ""gedwimer"" (sorcery), and ""lic"" (corpse); in Rohirric the term is said to mean 'spectre' or 'work of necromancy'.
Among Tolkien fans he has sometimes been called by the soubriquet Angmar, the name of the realm he once founded and ruled (similar to how a real-life earl/duke/marquess etc. is referred to by his peerage: e.g. Arthur Wellesley, Duke of Wellington who defeated Napoleon at Waterloo, is simply ""Wellington""). Many also identify the Witch-king as one of the three Black Númenóreans Tolkien stated had become Nazgûl, or possibly Isilmo, a Númenórean prince and father of Tar-Minastir. In the now-defunct Middle-earth Role Playing game, he was named Er-Murazor, a Númenórean prince, though this is strictly non-canonical. In the Angband computer game he was listed as Murazor, the Witch-king of Angmar.

 Portrayal in adaptations 
 Films 
 The Lord of the Rings film trilogy 
""Do you not know death when you see it, old man? This is my hour! You have failed. The world of men will fall.""
—The Witch-king to Gandalf in the The Return of the King

The Lord of the Nazgûl appears in all three of Peter Jackson's Lord of the Rings films. He is portrayed by Brent McIntyre in wraith form in The Fellowship of the Ring and The Two Towers and by Lawrence Makoare in The Return of the King. Ben Price portrays him in human form in flashbacks. He is voiced by Andy Serkis.
In The Fellowship of the Ring, he appears unnamed as one of the nine Nazgûl. He is shown briefly as a king of men in the prologue, and serves as one of the primary antagonists throughout the film alongside the other Ringwraiths. He is the Ringwraith who stabs Frodo with a Morgul-blade on Weathertop, although this is only revealed in The Return of the King by Gandalf.
The Nazgûl-lord returns in The Two Towers atop his Fellbeast, hunting for the Ring in the Dead Marshes. His presence causes Frodo to once more feel the wound dealt by him at Weathertop, as later confirmed in the next film.

It is only in The Return of the King that the ""Witch-king"" is identified by this name and becomes an antagonist separate from the other Nazgûl. He is now identified by a distinctive helmet and armour, and wields a giant flail and flaming sword in battle. The Witch-king first appears in an introductory scene via Gandalf's description, and is later seen by Frodo, Sam and Gollum leaving Minas Morgul with a massive army.     The Witch-king confronts Gandalf and Pippin in Minas Tirith.  He serves as Sauron's commander at the Battle of the Pelennor Fields, giving orders to the orc lieutenant Gothmog. During the battle itself, the Witch-king joins the other Ringwraiths in destroying various buildings and material inside Minas Tirith while the orc army besieges the city. In an extended scene, he confronts Gandalf and breaks the wizard's staff using dark magic. As he is about to strike down Gandalf, the reinforcements of Rohirrim arrive and the Witch-king departs for battle. Later, as Théoden musters his knights to attack the Haradrim, the Witch-king swoops out of the sky and tosses Théoden of Rohan beneath his horse. As he is about to finish off the stricken king, Éowyn arrives and confronts him. The two duel briefly before Merry stabs the Witch-king in the leg, disabling him and allowing Éowyn to deliver the killing blow. Unlike the novel, the Witch-king does not know of Éowyn's gender when their duel at the Pelennor begins; Éowyn only takes off her helmet right before she deals the final blow.
The height of the Witch-king's powers and skills are demonstrated during the films. In The Fellowship of the Ring, for example, he easily evades the torch held by Aragorn at Weathertop and fights the Ranger sword-to-sword before he is backed onto the edge, forcing him to retreat; in the extended version of The Return of the King, he is portrayed as more powerful a sorcerer than even Gandalf. It should be noted, however, that the novels also portrayed the Witch-king's powers as varying significantly, as he and four other Nazgûl were driven off by Aragorn at Weathertop in The Fellowship. By The Return of the King, Gandalf himself was not certain which one of them was the more powerful.

 The Hobbit film trilogy 
    The Witch-king's spirit at Dol Guldur  
The Witch-king also appears in the The Hobbit: An Unexpected Journey, briefly fighting Radagast. The Witch-king's portrayal in the film is also different from in the book. In the film he is said to have been killed after the fall of Angmar and buried, prior to his revival by the Necromancer; in the book, however, the Witch-king does not die following the fall of Angmar, and instead goes to Dol Guldur. In The Hobbit: The Battle of the Five Armies, he, along with the other Ringwraiths, fight the White Council in Dol Guldur. After being defeated, they flee to Mordor with Sauron.

 Video games 
 The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King  
The Witch-king appears as a boss hero in all The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King (video game) games as a boss, although in the PS2/Xbox/GameCube the player merely shoots his Fell beast a number of times until it dies and crashes on the battlefield where the Witch King is then battled and killed by Éowyn in a cutscene. He was also in the Third Age PS2 game as a Pelennor Fields boss and in the GBA game as an optional Evil commander that focuses mainly on dealing out huge amounts of damage directly.

 The Battle for Middle-earth 
    The Witch-king as he appears in the game  His more notable appearance is in The Lord of the Rings: The Battle for Middle-earth II: The Rise of the Witch-king which features Angmar's rise to power and eventual destruction, including new heroes such as Morgomir.
In this game, the Witch-king's powers of sorcery come from elemental forces (of ice and the cold) and necromancy. He is noted for being extremely cruel, as he will attack friend and foe alike. The only two other units in the franchise that show this savagery are the Balrog and the Spectral Werewolf. He also has the largest health pool for a standard hero, at 8,000 health-points at the start, but has very little to any armor.

 Middle-earth: Shadow of War 
In Middle-earth: Shadow of War, the Witch-king appears as the ranger Talion's nemesis, and is shown taking the city of Minas Ithil and the palantir housed there. His appearance is similar to his depiction in The Hobbit films, albeit altered slightly.

 Games Workshop 
    The Witch-king with Flail, from Games Workshop.com  Games Workshop has released several miniatures of the Witch-king based on his appearances in the movies. He is depicted on foot, riding a fellbeast and riding a horse. He is also included in a mini diorama depicting his last moments in The Return of the King.
 Weapons 
 Broadsword 
    View of the Witch-king's sword and armor     The sword of the Witch-king  
In films and game adaptations, the Witch-king's primary weapon is his fiery broadsword. It is seen in the game The Lord of the Rings: The Third Age, when he is attacking Éowyn and Berethor's party, who has joined with Éowyn against the mighty Lord of the Nazgûl.
Although not officially named in The Lord of the Rings books, those who preordered The Lord of the Rings: Conquest video game were given a replica of the Witch-king's sword. On the box art (and playing as the Witch-king in the game), EA provides a name for the weapon: The Sword of Terror.

 Mace 
The Witch-king's other primary weapon was a great, deadly mace which can shatter shields or kill enemies in one swing. Together with his sword, the Witch-king was an unstoppable force, vulnerable only to the combined efforts of an extremely lucky shield-maiden and hobbit whose blades were very powerful against the Witch-king specifically (a fact which was unknown to them).
In the movies, the Witch-king uses a flail instead of a mace, but with the same effectiveness.
In The Lord of the Rings: The Battle for Middle-earth II, the Witch-king is featured using a sword and a flail; however in the expansion pack, The Rise of the Witch-king, his character in the Angmar faction uses a steel sceptre, appearing as a small trident, and no flail.

 Morgul-blade 
    Morgul-Blade  
The Witch-king's smallest – yet still potent – weapon is a Morgul-blade, a deadly sorcerer's device that could slowly turn victims into a lesser wraith slave to the Nine and to Sauron. He used it on Frodo, in an attempt to claim the Ring and punish its bearer by putting him in a state worse than death. Fortunately for the hobbit, the blade failed to complete its task, as Frodo was swiftly brought to Rivendell and healed there by the ministrations of Elrond.

 Fellbeast 
Main article: Witch-king's Fellbeast

    The Witch-King upon his Fell-Beast  
Besides weapons crafted from forges in Mordor, the Witch-king also used his winged fellbeast as a method of attacking his enemies. This Fellbeast served two purposes: to take down enemy structures and catapults and to kill massive amounts of enemies at once. When the Witch-king (or indeed, any other Ringwraith) swooped down upon his enemies, they would flee in terror and attempt to save themselves (usually unsuccessfully). This fellbeast was finally slain by Éowyn via decapitation.

Ñoldor (House of Finwë)



Fëanor was a Ñoldorin elf and one of the Elven kindred that departed from Valinor in the land of Aman, where they had lived with the Valar. 
He was born in Valinor, the only child of Finwë, High King of the Ñoldor, and Finwë's first wife Míriel Therindë. He was a craftsman, gem-smith, and warrior, the maker of the Silmarils and inventor of the Tengwar script. He also created the Palantíri.
Fëanor was made the mightiest in all parts of body and mind; countenance, understanding, skill, and subtlety, of all the Children of Ilúvatar. However, in his personality came flaws, foremost among them selfishness and pride, and at a time these would bring anguish and turmoil to his people.

 Biography 
 Early life 
    Fëanor, by Luis F. Bejarano  
Fëanor drew so much of Míriel's life energy when he was born that she grew weary of living and her spirit voluntarily left her body, leaving her family for the Halls of Mandos. After a time, Finwë remarried and had four more children; Fëanor's half-brothers Fingolfin and Finarfin, and half-sisters Findis and Irimë. Though he loved his father as dearly as a son could, Fëanor was not fond of his stepmother Indis nor her children, and so lived apart from her and his half-siblings. In his youth, he quickly discovered his outstanding talents for craftsmanship and language. In his youth, he improved upon the work of Rúmil and created the system of writing known as Tengwar. He also became a student of Mahtan, a great smith who had learned his craft at the feet of Aulë himself. From Mahtan, he learned much of metallurgy, and at some point he wedded Mahtan's daughter Nerdanel, who bore him seven sons: Maedhros, Maglor, Celegorm, Caranthir, Curufin, Amrod, and Amras. He spent most of his time either alone or with his sons, and they were all completely loyal to him. He also was known to have been restless, exploring as much of Aman as he could and constantly crafting new works.[2]

 The making of the Silmarils 
By far the greatest of Fëanor's crafting achievements was the creation of the Silmarils, also called the Great Jewels. To make them, Fëanor captured some of the intermingled light from the Two Trees of Valinor and, by unknown means, locked it into three large diamond-like gems. His creations garnered him great praise, and he came to prize the Silmarils above all else. However, as time went on, he began to covet the gems with a greedy love, and he increasingly ignored the fact that the light which lay in the gems and gave them their beauty was not of his own making. Fëanor alternated between vainly displaying the jewels and jealously guarding them from all but his immediate family, though eventually he came to the point where they almost always remained under lock and key.[2][3]

 The wiles of Morgoth 
    Fëanor by kimberly80  
After three ages of imprisonment, Melkor, the mightiest of the Valar and the world's primordial source of evil, deceived the Valar with a false show of repentance. Pardoned and residing in Valinor, his malice had in fact reached hitherto unprecedented levels, and its primary target quickly became the Elves, as it had been for their sake that he had been overthrown. He found that, of the three primary groups of Elves in Valinor, the Ñoldor were the easiest to manipulate due to their thirst for knowledge and willingness to listen. Focusing his efforts solely on the Ñoldor, he subtly spread lies amongst them that the Valar were keeping them imprisoned in Valinor so that the race of Men might inherit Middle-earth and claim the glory that could have been theirs. Although Fëanor mistrusted and feared Melkor, in his arrogance and impatience he often unwittingly repeated the lies of Melkor. He quickly became the most prominent of the rebellious Ñoldor, to the point where the other Valar, not knowing of Melkor's lies, saw him as the source of the Ñoldor's distemper.
Melkor coveted the Silmarils and hated Fëanor, but he hid his intentions from the Ñoldor and the Valar as the situation continued to deteriorate. Melkor's lies eventually came to the point where rumors began to circulate amongst some that Fëanor's half-brother Fingolfin was planning not only to usurp his place as heir to Finwë, but also to seize the Silmarils for himself. In his pride and vanity, Fëanor took little convincing, and his hostility grew to the point to where he threatened Fingolfin with violence. The Valar, having put up with Fëanor's rabble-rousing for some time, could not ignore the transgression of breaking the peace of Valinor and so summoned Fëanor to the Ring of Doom to explain himself. Fëanor's testimony revealed the malice of Melkor and his lies, and Tulkas immediately left the Ring to apprehend him again. Despite Melkor having been the true root of the Ñoldor's unrest, Fëanor's crime had been of his own making, and for this the Valar exiled him to Formenos. He took a substantial treasure with him, including the Silmarils, which he put in a locked box. In a show of support for his eldest son, Finwë also withdrew to Formenos and renounced the kingship so long as Fëanor remained in exile.

    ""Get thee gone, and take thy due place!"", by Jenny Dolfen  
Some time later, Melkor unexpectedly appeared at Formenos where he tried to sway Fëanor to his side, proclaiming that the Valar had treated him unjustly. However, Fëanor realized that Melkor's true goal was to obtain the Silmarils, and he vehemently dismissed the fallen Vala. Melkor left in a rage and fled from Valinor. He feigned to go north, but ultimately turned south, passing as a cloud to the unexplored southern coast of Aman. Though Fëanor thought little of the incident, Finwë was filled with foreboding and reported Melkor's visit to the Valar immediately. However, they were unable to find so much as a trace of him, and after a time the Valar gave up the search.
Seven years later, the Valar announced a great feast at Valinor with the intention of repairing their relationship with the Ñoldor. Fëanor's exile was temporarily rescinded, and both he and Fingolfin were invited to attend. Though the Valar had intended for Finwë to come as well, he refused the invitation of the Valar due to Fëanor's continued exile and remained at Formenos. During the reconciliatory feast, Fingolfin extended a hand to his half-brother and openly recognized Fëanor's place as the eldest, but it was returned by Fëanor somewhat grudgingly.[2][3]

 Theft of the Silmarils 
Meanwhile, Melkor stole away to Avathar in the south of Aman. There he discovered the evil spider-like creature Ungoliant and secured her as an ally, promising to sate her unrelenting hunger in return for her aid. During the festivities at which Fëanor and Fingolfin had reconciled, Melkor and Ungoliant destroyed the Two Trees and plunged Valinor into complete darkness. Melkor and Ungoliant then went to Formenos, where Melkor slew Finwë and ransacked the vault, taking the Silmarils and many other treasures. They then escaped by crossing the Helcaraxë, or Grinding Ice, in the north to Beleriand in Middle-earth. Though the Valar attempted pursuit, it was ultimately in vain, for the Unlight of Ungoliant completely obscured the sight of the pursuers.
The Valar quickly realized that with the Trees dead, their light survived only in the Silmarils. To restore the Trees and foil Melkor's malice, Yavanna asked Fëanor to give up the Silmarils so that they could be broken, and the light within them released. But Fëanor emphatically stated that he would not give up his Silmarils of his own free will, and proclaimed that if the Valar forced him to do so that they would be no better than Melkor. Ultimately however, Fëanor's selfishness made little difference, for a messenger from Formenos then arrived to deliver the news of Finwë's death and the loss of the Silmarils.[4]

 The Flight of the Ñoldor 
    Fëanor with his sons swear the Oath of Fëanor  
Fëanor, upon learning of his father's murder and the theft of his prized Silmarils, named Melkor ""Morgoth"", or ""Black Foe of the World"" (literally ""Black Enemy""). As he did so, a great rage and despair gripped him, for he had loved his father as deeply as a son could, and he fled in grief from the Ring of Doom. Due to the fact that he had been at the Ring of Doom at the request of the Valar when his father had been murdered, he cursed the summons, and his grief quickly turned to bitterness against the Valar themselves. In his despair, he believed that had he been present at Formenos when Morgoth had come, he could have saved his father, though in truth there was nothing he could have potentially done.
Now King of the Ñoldor after the death of his father, Fëanor returned to Tirion, ignoring the fact that he was still technically exiled, and gave one of the most impassioned speeches ever delivered in Arda. But due to his rage, grief, and pride, he unwittingly filled his speech with many of the lies and half-truths of Morgoth. He railed against the Dark Lord, but he also blamed the Valar in part for Morgoth's deeds, claiming that they should have been able to stop him and had failed. He spoke of the fact that because Morgoth had attacked and badly marred the kingdom of the Valar without consequence to himself, there was neither bliss nor surety of safety to be found in Aman any longer. He evoked images of the kingdoms his people could build in Middle-earth, and the glory that could be theirs once they regained the Silmarils. Fëanor then swore an oath by the name of Ilúvatar himself that he would suffer none, no matter their race or reasons, to withhold a Silmaril from him, and that he would pursue with violence any who attempted it. The Oath of Fëanor was also taken by his seven sons below the tower of the Mindon Eldaliéva in the Great Square of Tirion. This oath became the cause for great tragedy for Fëanor's family, and for the Eldar in general. 
His impassioned speech swayed most of those present, but even with his tremendous oratory skill, dissension quickly arose regarding who should lead the hosts to Middle-earth. For though Fëanor was technically High King, he was not well liked amongst the Ñoldor, and many of them were not of mind to accept him as king. Greater love was given to Fingolfin and his sons, and most of the Ñoldor desired greatly that Fingolfin and his sons should go with them and lead them. Fingolfin was not eager to go, but he had sworn to uphold his brother's rights as the eldest, and furthermore he did not wish to leave his people to the mercy of Fëanor's rash and often selfish courses of action. Additionally, his son Fingon was eager to undertake the journey, and urged his father to come along. Thus against his wisdom, Fingolfin marched with a second and larger host than Fëanor, while Finarfin commanded a third, smaller, and rather reluctant host. However even with the three sons of Finwë leading the way, about a tenth of the Ñoldor chose simply to stay in Tirion, some for the love of Tirion and others for love of the Valar.[4][5]

 The First Kinslaying 
    The battle in which the Noldor attacked the Teleri  
After delivering his speech and departing with his host, Fëanor's mood cooled somewhat and he belatedly realized that he had no practical means of delivering himself and his people to Middle-earth. For though Middle-earth and Aman were connected in those days by the Helcaraxë, a treacherous and bitterly cold region of shifting arctic ice, it was deemed to be impassable. Fëanor then gave thought to the building of ships, but there were no shipwrights amongst the Ñoldor and even had there been, crafting a fleet large enough to ferry all of his people to Middle-earth would have been a monumental and time consuming task. Fëanor therefore went to Alqualondë where the seafaring Teleri lived and attempted to persuade them to join him, or failing that, to secure the use of their ships. But the Teleri had no desire whatsoever to leave Aman and would not give Fëanor their ships, for they held them too dearly. Fëanor angrily cited that the Teleri owed the Ñoldor for instructing them in the arts of crafting buildings and cities. But Olwë, the lord of the Teleri, was unmoved, and rebuffed again in friendship what he saw as great folly by Fëanor and his kin.
But Fëanor would not take no for an answer. He understood that many of his people had been inflamed by his impassioned words, and knew that haste was essential to keep cooler heads from swaying the Ñoldor to a more reasonable course. As such, he persuaded his host to aid him in taking the ships by force. This he attempted, and the Teleri resisted, casting many of the the Ñoldor into the sea and thrice driving them back despite being far more lightly armed than the Ñoldor. However, Fingolfin's host, which had been less eager to start the journey and thus slower, came upon the battle in progress. Believing that the Teleri had been the aggressors, perhaps even on the orders of the Valar themselves, Fingolfin's host came to the aid of his brother's and the Teleri were overcome. The ships were stolen, and many of the Teleri mariners were wickedly slain. After commandeering the ships, the Ñoldor, their hosts lessened by battle and by terrible storms conjured by Ossë in vengeance for the Teleri, encountered a figure that may have been Mandos himself. This figure uttered a terrible Doom, exiling the Ñoldor from Valinor and foretelling that their war against Morgoth would cause them only misery. Due to their wickedness in slaughtering their kin, they would be utterly forsaken in the eyes of the Valar, and would receive neither welcome nor aid from Valinor in their struggles. Additionally, Fëanor and his house were cursed, and Mandos foretold great suffering and hardship would be their lot, due in no small part to the oath they had taken to regain the Silmarils at all costs. Above all, the figure made it explicitly clear that any war made by the Ñoldor against Morgoth would be utterly hopeless, for the Ñoldor, being Elves, simply did not have the power to overcome a Vala. Hearing this Doom, and having not participated in the Kinslaying, Finarfin and his host and turned back in grief, cursing Fëanor.[See Note] They were pardoned and accepted by the Valar, and Finarfin ruled as High-King of the Ñoldor in Tirion. Fëanor, however, defied the Doom and proceeded onward. As such the journey northward continued, the land became ever darker, and the temperatures began to drop dramatically as the Ñoldor approached the Helcaraxë. It was at this point that many of the Ñoldor, already reluctant to follow Fëanor, began to openly express dissatisfaction with his actions. For despite having succeeded in seizing the Teleri fleet, the storms of Ossë had wreaked many of the ships, and there were no longer enough to bear all of the Ñoldor at once to Middle-earth. However, the Doom of Mandos had kindled fear of treachery in the heart of the Ñoldor, and none were willing to be left in Aman while others crossed the sea first. Fëanor was all too aware of both the dissatisfaction of his people and the problem that lay in ferrying all of them to Middle-earth, and sought counsel with his sons.

    Fëanor watches on at the burning of the Teleri boats  
However, Fëanor's most loyal forces had maintained control of the Teleri fleet after having seized it. As the dissent grew worse, Fëanor decided to simply abandon all those whose loyalty to him was not absolute, and he and his followers slipped away one night in the ships. They arrived at Losgar, in the land of Lammoth, in the far west of Beleriand, where Morgoth and Ungoliant had passed not long before, and upon arriving, Fëanor decided to burn the ships and leave the followers of Fingolfin behind. The earth, being flat in those days, allowed the remaining Ñoldor to see the flames, and they perceived that they were betrayed. Fingolfin now had the choice of either returning to Tirion in disgrace, or proceeding to Middle-earth across the treacherous Helcaraxë. Fingolfin and his people chose to attempt the crossing, as many of Fingolfin's host wished to continue and many, including Fingolfin himself, were eager to confront Fëanor and his people over their betrayal. The journey was a long and terrible one, and Fingolfin's host suffered great losses along the way, which added to the bitterness they felt for Fëanor and his sons.[5]

 Final battle and death 
Learning of the Ñoldor's arrival, Morgoth summoned his armies from his fortress of Angband and attacked Fëanor's encampment in Mithrim. This confrontation was called the Battle under the Stars, or Dagor-nuin-Giliath, for the Sun and Moon had not yet been made. The Ñoldor won the battle handily, and destroyed Morgoth's armies. But Fëanor, exhilarated by the victory and ever prideful, pressed on toward Angband far ahead of his army with only a small vanguard. As he approached Angband, the Orcs, seeing that Fëanor's numbers were so few, turned and gave battle. Due to their proximity to Angband, they were reinforced by a number of Balrogs, who quickly slew most of the Elves. But Fëanor was undaunted, and though he was dealt many wounds, he long fought on alone. At last however, he was stricken to the ground by Gothmog, the Lord of the Balrogs.  

     
Fortunately for Fëanor, his sons arrived with a substantial relief force. The Balrogs returned to Angband, and Fëanor's sons took him from the battlefield. However, Fëanor knew that his wounds were mortal, and bade his sons to stop. He looked upon Angband and cursed Morgoth thrice, but gazing upon the sheer scope of Morgoth's stronghold, he understood at last the truth of Mandos's words; that no force of the Ñoldor would ever overthrow the Dark Lord. Nevertheless, he instructed his sons to keep to their oath and avenge their father. As he died, his fiery spirit left his body and burned it to ash.[5]

 Legacy 
On Fëanor's passing, his son Maedhros became High King of the Ñoldor. Maedhros, however, met Fingolfin soon after and gave the kingship to him out of respect, a desire to keep his people united, and an acknowledgment that, as Finwë's oldest surviving son, the kingship ought to pass to him by right of birth.[6] Fingolfin's descendents would reign over the Nôldor until the death of Gil-galad many centuries later. Fëanor's deeds, many of which were infamously despicable, cast a shadow over the interactions between the Sindar and the returning Ñoldor. For Thingol, the King of Doriath, eventually learned of the Kinslaying, the burning of the ships at Losgar, and the curse of Mandos. As the Teleri were of Thingol's own kin, he was enraged to hear of the merciless and needless slaughter. The sons of Finarfin he came to forgive, as they were of his own kin and had not participated in the evil. Those of Fingolfin's host, who had endured the horror of crossing the Helcaraxë after Fëanor's betrayal, he held as having suffered enough hardship to redress their ills. But all those who had followed Fëanor, were of his kin, or were friends of his kin, Thingol held in contempt and would have as little to do with as he could. Fëanor's remaining sons were still bound by the Oath to recover the Silmarils, and this oath would eventually see two more Kinslayings come to pass, each more horrific than the last, and would work to undermine the Elven war against Morgoth in many important ways. The Doors of Durin would later bear the emblem of the House of Fëanor: a single star with many rays.

 Etymology 
Originally named Finwë or Finweminya after his father, and later Curufinwë (""Skillful [son of] Finwë""), he was the greatest of the Ñoldor, and very briefly their king. His name is a compromise between the Sindarin Faenor and the Quenya Fëanáro, meaning ""Spirit of fire"".[7]

 Etymology

Tarannon was the twelfth King of Gondor.

Contents[show]
 Biography 
Tarannon succeeded his father Siriondil in TA 830. His brother was Tarciryan. He started the construction of Gondor's navies, and became known as the first of the so-called 'Ship-kings'. Under his policies and successful rule, Gondor's extended its power to the west and south of the Mouths of Anduin. He, along with Narmacil I, was one of two childless Kings of Gondor — meaning that he was a ""breakpoint"" in the bloodline. Nevertheless his rule was marked by such vigorous naval expansion that at his coronation he took the regnal name of Falastur, which meant 'Lord of the Coasts'.[2]
Despite his successes, his reign was troubled by the intrigues of his own wife Queen Berúthiel who spied on everyone within the kingdom. Eventually, he grew tired of her after she had gone too far and send her and her cats in into exile in the south.[3] As a result of his wife's exile, he died childless (in TA 913) and was succeeded by his nephew Eärnil I.[2]

Etymology
Tarannon was a Quenya word that meant 'Royal-gate'.[4] Falastur was apparently an Elvish word that meant 'Lord of the Coasts'.[2][4]

Ciryandil was the fourteenth King of Gondor and the third Ship-king.

Contents[show]
 Biography 
Ciryandil was born in the year TA 820 and succeeded his father Eärnil I in TA 936.[1] During his reign, he continued Eärnil's naval policies and spent his life defending the recently captured port of Umbar against the Black Númenóreans who had lived there before, and the Haradrim who wished to capture the port.
In TA 1015 after a reign of 79 years, he was slain while Umbar was besieged. He was succeeded by his son Ciryaher (also known as Hyarmendacil).[2]

 Etymology 
Ciryandil was a Quenyan word that meant 'Ship-lover'[3] or 'Ship-friend.[citation needed]","

Atanatar II was the sixteenth King of Gondor.
Gondor enjoyed its greatest wealth and power under him.

Contents[show]
 Biography 
Atanatar was born in the year TA 977.[1] Atanatar succeeded his father Hyarmendacil I in TA 1149 as the sixteenth King of Gondor. His wealth was so great that historians remarked that ""precious stones are pebbles in Gondor for children to play with"". He was also known as Atanatar Alcarin, ""Atanatar the Glorious,"" (alcarin being the Quenya word for glorious), but the deeds of Atanatar weren't as glorious as his appellation would indicate. Atanatar made no effort to expand or maintain the power that his father commanded and the guard on Mordor was neglected. Therefore his reign is seen as the start of Gondor's decline before the War of the Ring.
He was succeeded by his son Narmacil I upon his death in TA 1226 after ruling for seventy-seven years.[2]

 Etymology 
Atanatar is Quenya for ""father of man"". It comes from the words atan, meaning ""man"" (usually in reference to mortal men), and atar, meaning ""father"".[citation needed]","

Narmacil I was the seventeenth King of Gondor after the death of his father Atanatar II Alcarin in TA 1226. Like Falastur before him, he was notable for his childlessness.

Contents[show]
Biography
Narmacil was born in the year TA 1049 to Atanatar II and his unnamed wife. He was as lazy as his father and was soon tired of being King. He reigned as king properly for fourteen years. Then, probably intending to pursue his own personal pleasures and activities, he created the noble title of Regent and surrendered practical rule to his nephew Minalcar by TA 1240 (who would eventually become King in his own right).
During his reign, the Easterlings started to become a threat again and his regent's main concern was making alliance with the tribes of the Northmen to help fight against them.[2] After this event it is unknown whether Narmacil retained any power. He died childless in TA 1294 after sixty-eight years of mostly inactive rule and was succeeded by his brother Calmacil.[2]

Mardil Voronwë was a noble Man of Gondor from the House of Húrin during the mid-Third Age, who held these offices:

Steward to King Eärnil II (TA 2029 - TA 2043);
Steward to King Eärnur (TA 2043 - TA 2050);
First Ruling Steward of Gondor (TA 2050 - TA 2080).

Contents[show]
 Biography 
Mardil Voronwë was the son of the Vorondil, a great hunter of beasts.[2][3] During his youth, the position of Steward was already a hereditary title. The stewardship had resided with his line since the days of his grandfather Pelendur. Mardil received the title of Steward on the death of his father Vorondil in TA 2029. His Stewardship began during the last part of the reign of King Eärnil II and throughout the reign of Eärnur, Eärnil's son.
During Eärnur's reign as king, Mardil was charged with the difficult task of restraining the wrath of Eärnur to fight the Witch-king of Angmar, the chief of the Ringwraiths, who accused Eärnur after the Battle of Fornost of being afraid to fight him.
The King of Minas Morgul (one of the titles of the Ringwraith) reminded Eärnur of this and challenged him at the start of his reign TA 2043. Although Eärnur wanted to fight the King of Morgul he was restrained with difficulty by Mardil. However, when the Witch-king issued another challenge with great insult seven years later in TA 2050, Mardil could not restrain Eärnur, who then marched to Minas Morgul and was never seen again.[4]
Eärnur did not marry and thus had no children, so Mardil took it upon himself to rule Gondor. There was no one with a clear and unassailable claim to the throne, so the rule of the Stewards was a way of averting civil war. Because the fate of the King was unknown, Mardil made an oath to rule until ""the King returns"". This oath would be sworn by all of the Ruling Stewards. Mardil ruled Gondor with a steady hand and earned the nickname Voronwë, which means ""the Steadfast"" in Quenya.
During his rule, the Watchful Peace began when Sauron retreated from Dol Guldur in TA 2063 and went back to Mordor. It was soon learned that Eärnur had met certain death at Minas Morgul, and upon Mardil's death in TA 2080 at the age of 120 years old, his son Eradan succeeded him as the second Ruling Steward of Gondor.
After Mardil's rule his successors stopped using High-elven names in their official names.[2]

 Etymology 
Mardil is a Quenyan word that means 'Friend of the (Royal) House'.[5]

Contents[show]
Biography
Hador was born in TA 2245 and was the only son of his father Túrin I. Following the death of his father, Túrin I, in TA 2278 Hador became the seventh Ruling Steward of Gondor, and the seventh steward to rule during the era known as the Watchful Peace. During his time as Steward and the three hundredth anniversary of the Steward's Reckoning, the calendar system created by Mardil Voronwë was modified by him adding one day to it to make it more accurate to suit the times. Hador ruled Gondor until his death in TA 2395 at the age of 150 years old after a rule of one-hundred and seventeen years. Upon his death he was succeeded by his son Barahir.
Hador was the last noble Man of Gondor to live such a long life.[3]

Etymology
Hador (or hadron) is a Quenya word which means ""thrower of spears or darts"".[4]

 Trivia 
 Hador ruled Gondor for 117 years; in fact his reign was longer than the final kings of Numenor.

Cirion was the twelfth Ruling Steward of Gondor.

Contents[show]
Biography
Born in TA 2449, Cirion was the son of Boromir, the eleventh Ruling Steward of Gondor. Cirion became the twelfth Steward when his father died in TA 2489.
During his rule in TA 2509, the Balchoth gathered for an assault upon Gondor, passing over the Undeeps of Anduin into the northern province of Calenardhon. Cirion could not spare many men to defend this part of his realm, and in despair he sent several messengers to their old friends the Éothéod, a people living in the far north.
Only one man, Borondir, reached the Éothéod capital of Framsburg, and delivered his message to the king Eorl the Young.
After not receiving any answer for a full year, in TA 2510 Cirion set out west through Anórien, to prevent the Balchoth from crossing the Anduin at the Undeeps and the Wold.
The army of Gondor was defeated and driven back across the river Limlight to the Field of Celebrant. In what was probably a coordinated attack, the orcs came out of the Hithaeglir (Misty Mountains), and assailed the flank from the west, driving the forces of Gondor towards the Anduin. All hope was lost, when unlooked for came the riders of Éothéod out of the North. Together the Éothéod and the army of Gondor defeated the Balchoth and orcs, driving them into the Wold.
Cirion was a wise man, and saw that he could use the Éothéod further. He told Eorl that he would leave Calenardhon in his care, and meet Eorl again in three months' time. Back at Minas Tirith, Cirion ordered some of his most trusted servants to go to the Firien Woods in Anórien, and in secret clear the way to the mountain of Amon Anwar at the Halifirien beacon.

    The Oath of Cirion and Eorl, by artist Anke Eissmann.  
Three months later, Cirion, his son Hallas, the Prince of Dol Amroth, and two others Councilors of Gondor set out for Calenardhon, and Cirion met with Eorl. They ascended Amon Anwar, and Cirion revealed the shrine to Elendil, built in secret at this mountain, as it formed the centre of the Gondor of old. At this secret place, he revealed his plan to give Calenardhon as a free gift to the Éothéod, so that there should be a perpetual friendship between the Éothéod and the people of Gondor. On the behalf of his people, Eorl accepted this deal, swearing the Oath of Eorl and becoming the first King of Rohan.[3]
Cirion, died in the year TA 2567, at the age of 118 years old.[1] He was succeeded by his son Hallas.

Hallas was born in TA 2480 and was the son of Cirion. When Cirion died in TA 2567, Hallas succeeded him as Ruling Steward. Calenardhon had been given by his father to the Éothéod, and this people began to migrate to the land. Hallas devised the names Rochand and Rochirrim for the land and its people, which became Rohan and Rohirrim in the Sindarin dialect of Gondor. In effect, Gondor had been halved in size, but it had gained a strong ally to the north in return.[3]
War never ceased on Gondor's eastern borders as the Balchoth were not completely destroyed, but they were no longer a serious threat. More of a problem was the Corsairs of Umbar, who kept raiding the coasts.
Hallas died in TA 2605 at the age of 125 years old after thirty-eight years of rule. He was succeeded by his son Húrin II.

 Other versions of the legendarium 
In some early variants of the Quenta Silmarillion, tradition published in the History of Middle-earth series, Hallas is also the name of the son of Orodreth. He was replaced by Gil-galad, later High King of the Ñoldor, who in the published Silmarillion is made into Fingon's son instead. That Orodreth's son was named Hallas was an earlier idea, but Gil-galad replaced him. In the published The Silmarillion, Orodreth has no son.

Ecthelion I was the seventeenth Ruling Steward of Gondor.[2]

Contents[show]
 Biography 
Born in TA 2600, Ecthelion was the son of Orodreth. Ecthelion succeeded his father as Steward in TA 2685. Although, the Corsairs of Umbar were the major threat to Gondor at the time, the most notable event during his reign was the rebuilding of the White Tower in Minas Tirith. In his honour it later became known as the White Tower of Ecthelion. Ecthelion I died childless in TA 2698 at the age of ninety-eight. Since, Ecthelion I had no children at the time of his death, after his death the Stewardship of Gondor passed to Egalmoth, Ecthelion's first cousin once removed.[2]

 Etymology 
Ecthelion might have been named after the Lord of Gondolin, Ecthelion of the Fountain. The name means ""Spear-point"", from the Quenya ehtë (""spear"") and thela (""point of spear"").[3]

Contents[show]
Biography
Egalmoth was born in TA 2626. He was the grandson of Morwen, the daughter of Belecthor I, and the great-nephew of Orodreth. When, the seventeenth Ruling Steward Ecthelion I died in TA 2698 without issue, Egalmoth succeeded his cousin as Steward. The majority of Egalmoth's rule passed uneventfully; however, three years before his death in TA 2740 the orcs renewed their war on Gondor. Egalmoth died in TA 2743 at the age of 117 years old after a rule of forty-five years, and was succeeded by his son Beren.[2]

Etymology
Egalmoth might have been named after the Lord of Gondolin, Egalmoth. Though the name has unknown meaning, it consists of the Sindarin word moth (""dusk"").[3]

Beren was the nineteenth Ruling Steward of Gondor.

Contents[show]
 History 
Beren was born in TA 2655 and was the son of Egalmoth. When Egalmoth died in 2743, Beren succeeded him as the Ruling Steward. He spent much of his reign fighting the Corsairs of Umbar in southern Gondor.
During the Long Winter of TA 2758 to TA 2759, the Corsairs of Umbar attacked Gondor, and Rohan came under attack from the Dunlendings. Initially, both nations were under attack, and neither could help the other. Once the Corsairs attacking Gondor had been defeated, Beren sent a force under the command of his son Beregond north to the aid of Rohan and its war with the Dunlendings.
In TA 2759, Saruman suddenly appeared and requested leave to dwell in Isengard, Beren gladly gave the Keys of Orthanc to Saruman and appointed him Warden answerable only to the Steward, because he believed Saruman could help both Gondor and Rohan recover from the effects of the Long Winter.[2]
Beren died in TA 2763 at the age of 108 years old, and he was succeeded by his son Beregond.[2]

 Etymology 
The name Beren means ""Bold"" in Ñoldorin Quenya.[3] He might have been named after the hero of the First Age, Beren.

Beregond was the twentieth Ruling Steward of Gondor.

Contents[show]
 Biography 
Beregond was born in TA 2700 to the Steward Beren.
During the Long Winter of TA 2758 - TA 2759, the Corsairs of Umbar attacked Gondor and a combined force of Dunlendings and Corsairs of Umbar sailed up the Isen and besieged Rohan, initially both nations were under attack neither could help the other. However, the Corsairs who attacked Gondor were defeated before the coming of spring and the Steward Beren dispatched a force under the command of his son Beregond who was a great warrior and sea captain north to Rohan to relieve the besieged Rohirrim. Together the forces of Beregond and Fréaláf Hildeson the King of Rohan defeated both the Corsairs and Dunlendings.[2]
Beregond's father, Beren died in TA 2763 and Beregond succeeded him as the twentieth Ruling Steward.
In the thirtieth year of Beregond's stewardship in TA 2793, Middle-earth saw the beginning of the six year War between the Dwarves and the Orcs that culminated in the Battle of Azanulbizar in TA 2799. During the course of the six year conflict many Orcs sought to take refuge in the safety of White Mountains. The Men of Gondor led by Beregond slew many orcs that attempted to reestablish themselves in the White Mountains, and prevented the orcs from establishing large scale settlements and strongholds in the White Mountains.[2]
Beregond died in TA 2811 at the age of 111 years old and was succeeded by his son Belecthor II.[2]

 Etymology 
It is possible that the name Beregond means ""Bold Stone"", from the Sindarin words beren (""bold"") and gond (""stone"").[3][4]

Belecthor II was the twenty-first Ruling Steward of Gondor.

Contents[show]
 Biography 
Belecthor was born in TA 2752 and was the only child of Beregond. When his father died in TA 2811, Belecthor succeeded him as the twenty-first Ruling Steward. Belecthor continued his father's campaigns against the Corsairs of Umbar and the Orcs. The White Council met in TA 2850; at the meeting, Gandalf urged an attack on Dol Guldur to drive Sauron out, but Saruman overruled him. Belecthor died in TA 2872 at the age of 120 years old after a rule of sixty-one years. When he died, the White Tree of Gondor was neglected and eventually withered and died, and no sapling or seedling was found to replace it. So the withered tree was left standing until the return of the king.[2]
Belecthor was succeeded by his son Thorondir.[2]

 Etymology 
The name Belecthor means ""Mighty eagle"", from the Sindarin beleg (""mighty"") and thor(on) (""eagle"").[3] He might have been named after the fifteenth Ruling Steward, Belecthor I.

Thorondir was the twenty-second Ruling Steward of Gondor.[2]

Contents[show]
Biography
Thorondir was born in TA 2782 and was the son of Belecthor II. During the later parts of his father's reign, the White Tree began to die, and when Belecthor passed away in TA 2872 so did the tree fully. Thorondir then succeeded him as the twenty-second Ruling Steward. During his reign, he decided not to remove the remains of the White Tree, instead leaving it standing in hope that the king would return someday. Nothing more is recorded about his reign but that it was probably a peaceful one.[2]
Thorondir died in TA 2882 at the age of 100 after ten years of rule and was succeeded by his son Túrin II.[2]

Etymology
Although the name Thorondir has no given meaning, it consists of the Sindarin thor(on) (""eagle"").[3][4]

Túrin II was the twenty-third Ruling Steward of Gondor.[2]

Contents[show]
 Biography 
Born in TA 2815, Túrin II was the son of Thorondir, who died in TA 2882. Túrin then succeeded him as the twenty-third Ruling Steward.[2]
In TA 2885 Túrin fought the Haradrim at the Crossings of Poros in South Ithilien with the aid of a contingent of Rohirrim led by Prince Folcred and Prince Fastred the twin sons of King Folcwine. The Haradrim were defeated but, in the course of the battle both Prince Folcred and Fastred were slain. After the victory Túrin paid King Folcwine a great weregild of gold.[2]
During the stewardship of Túrin II, Ithilien was attacked again by Mordor and many of the inhabitants withdrew west over the Anduin with only the hardiest of individuals remaining. Ithilien became a wilderness infested by Orcs from Mordor. In North Ithilien the Men of Gondor reestablished the hidden fortress of Henneth Annûn and the Men of Gondor fortified the isle of Cair Andros.[2]
Túrin died in TA 2914 at the age of ninety-nine after a rule of thirty-two years and was succeeded by his son Turgon.[2]

 Etymology 
Túrin comes from the Sindarin word tur (""power, mastery"").[3][4] He might have been named after the tragic hero of the First Age, Túrin Turambar.

Turgon was the twenty-fourth Ruling Steward of Gondor.

Contents[show]
 Biography 
Born in TA 2855, Turgon was the son of Túrin II.[2]
Túrin II died in TA 2914 and Turgon succeeded to the Stewardship of Gondor. Turgon's rule was largely peaceful, however, two years before the end of Turgon's stewardship was the re-emergence of Sauron. In TA 2951 Sauron began to move openly again, he re-occupied Mordor, rebuilding and re-fortifying Barad-dûr.[2]
Turgon died in TA 2953 at the age of ninety-eight years old after a rule of thirty-nine years and was succeeded by his son Ecthelion II. When news of Turgon's death reached Saruman, he declared himself Lord of Isengard and took de facto possession of Orthanc which he then fortified.[2]

 Etymology 
It is possible that the name Turgon comes from the Sindarin word tur (""power, mastery"").[3][4] He is likely that he was named after the King of Gondolin, Turgon.

Ecthelion II was the twenty-fifth Ruling Steward of Gondor.

Contents[show]
 Biography 
Born in TA 2886, Ecthelion was the son of Turgon. Ecthelion succeeded his father when he died in TA 2953 at the age of ninety-eight years. When news of Turgon's death reached Saruman he declared himself Lord of Isengard and took possession of Orthanc which he then fortified. Ecthelion was a Steward of great wisdom but was powerless to prevent the appropriation of Isengard and Orthanc, so he did what he could to strengthen Gondor's defences with what limited resources he possessed, and supplemented Gondor's diminished forces by encouraging outsiders and foreigners that possessed a good character to enter into the service of Gondor and Ecthelion rewarded those individuals that proved their worth.
Aragorn son of Arathorn served Ecthelion, although by the name of Thorongil to hide his true identity. In this guise Aragorn became one of Ecthelion's most trusted and loyal retainers. Thorongil persuaded the Steward to send him to destroy the threat posed by the Corsairs of Umbar, and in TA 2980 the Corsairs were routed, the majority of their fleet was destroyed, and their leader, the Captain of the Haven, was slain. Thorongil also advised Ecthelion to listen to the counsels of Gandalf as opposed to those of Saruman, which Ecthelion did willingly. However, the great esteem and many honors that Ecthelion gave to Thorongil and Gandalf incurred the jealousy and anger of Denethor who felt both slighted and threatened.
In TA 2984, Ecthelion died at the age of ninety-eight years old after a rule of thirty-one years and was succeeded by his son Denethor II.[2]

 Etymology 
The name Ecthelion has three recorded meanings:

It is said to derive from the Quenya ehtelë (""issue of water, spring"")[3]
Another entry lists the name origin as ehtë (""spear"") and thela (""point of spear""), which means ""Spear-point""[4]
It is said to be derived from aeg (""sharp"") and thel (""intent, resolve""). This would translate to ""one of sharp resolve"".[5]

""Yet a Halfling still, and little love do I bear the name, since those accursed words came to trouble our counsels and drew away my son on the wild errand to his death. My Boromir! Now we have need of you. Faramir should have gone in his stead.""
—Denethor, upon meeting Gandalf and Pippin Took in Minas Tirith[4]

Denethor II was the twenty-sixth Ruling Steward of Gondor, and father of the War of the Ring heroes Boromir and Faramir.

Contents[show]
 Biography 
Denethor was the first child and eldest son of Ecthelion II.[1] In TA 2976, he married Finduilas of Dol Amroth, daughter of Prince Adrahil II of Dol Amroth.[5] Together, the couple had two sons, Boromir and Faramir. A few years later, in TA 2988, Finduilas died, leaving Denethor bitter.[6]
He succeeded his father Ecthelion II as twenty-sixth Ruling Steward in TA 2984. During his stewardship, Gandalf was less welcome in Minas Tirith, and his counsels went unheeded.

 War of the Ring 
Denethor secretly used a Palantír to probe Sauron's strength, and he used it at the top of the White Tower in his secret chamber, above the Throne room.[7] The effort aged him quickly, and the knowledge of Sauron's overwhelming force exacerbated the bitterness that had taken root at the time of the death of his wife, Finduilas, in TA 2988. Sauron used the Palantír to drive him mad with despair. He retained, however, an air of nobility and power. The death of Boromir, his eldest son and favorite, and the siege and apparent doom of the capital city drove Denethor further along the path to madness. Following this, he became estranged from Faramir. Shockingly, Faramir still upheld his father's wishes.[5]
His actions, however, did not immediately proclaim his insanity. The Osgiliath mission was not obviously suicidal, as the city had not yet been overrun. The Warning beacons of Gondor had been lit, but Denethor expected little help in his growing despair.[8]
He committed suicide on March 15, 3019, having ordered his men to erect a pyre for him and Faramir in the Hallows of Minas Tirith. He threw a torch onto the pyre, then broke the white rod of his office over his knee and cast it into the flames, symbolizing the end of his stewardship and the end of the rule of the Stewards. He laid himself down on the table and so perished, clasping the Palantíri in his hands. His attempt to take the grievously injured and apparently dying Faramir with him was thwarted by the timely intervention of Beregond and ultimately, by Gandalf.[3]
Denethor II ruled as the Steward of Gondor for 35 years, from TA 2984 until his death on TA 3019. The title of the Ruling Steward was passed to his son, Faramir, who also became the first of the Princes of Ithilien.[9]

 Etymology 
Denethor might have been named after the tenth Ruling Steward of Gondor, who, in turn, was named after a Nandorin Elf. The name comes from the Nandorin words dene (""strong, lithe"") and thara (""tall, slender""), and gives the name a meaning of ""Lithe and lank"".[10]

Castamir the Usurper usurped the throne of Gondor from Eldacar, ruling from TA 1437 to 1447 of the Third Age, until he was violently deposed at the Battle of Erui.

 Biography 
The great-grandson of the unremarkable King Calmacil, Castamir was not in line for the throne, but his royal background had made him the Lord of Ships under the previous king, Valacar. His lineage and influence left him in a position to challenge the current king, Eldacar, who was only half Dúnadan. As King Valacar's only son, Eldacar was the legitimate heir to the throne, but his half Rhovanion lineage angered citizens who believed in a pure dúnedain royalty. Capitalizing on what became outright protest against the current king, Castamir was able to incite rebellion and besiege Eldacar within the city Osgiliath in TA 1437 of the Third Age. The city was set on fire by Castamir's troops, destroying the famed Dome of Stars. Shortly thereafter, Eldacar fled the city and into exile in Rhovanion, to the north. With the defeat of the king, Castamir seized the throne.
For ten years Castamir ruled Gondor with an iron fist, while Eldacar quietly regained power. Castamir ruled cruelly, and committed many foul deeds, including executing Eldacar's own son, Ornendil. At first the people of Gondor tolerated Castamir because of his pure Númenórean blood. Then, in 1447, Castamir, now called ""the Usurper"" by his people was overthrown after a decade of wicked rule with the people now rallying around the true king, Eldacar. He was slain by Eldacar's forces at the Battle of Erui, the decisive battle of the Kin-strife as this period came to be known. At the Crossings of Erui, Eldacar personally slew Castamir.
Castamir's influence did not end there. Remnants of his forces, and his surviving sons, retreated from the Battle of Erui to the port of Pelargir and escaped by ship to Umbar, far to the south. These descendants of Castamir became the so-called ""Corsairs of Umbar"", fierce pirates who terrorized the ports of Gondor with the help of the men of Harad. They were perhaps the greatest threat to Gondor for nearly 400 years, commanding massive fleets of ships. Their most infamous exploit was the Raid of Pelargir in TA 1634, in which a Corsair armada led by his great-grandsons Angamaitë‎ and Sangahyando‎ sailed up the river Anduin to the port of Pelargir, deep in Gondor's territory. This raid coincided with the young King Minardil's visit, and he was slain in by the Corsairs as they attacked.
They remained a significant threat until TA 1810, when King Telumehtar of Gondor retook Umbar. So great a victory was this, that forever after Telumehtar was known as Umbardacil, which literally means ""victor over Umbar"". In this battle the last descendants of Castamir were finally killed.[2][1]

Hyarmendacil II was the twenty-fourth King of Gondor.

Contents[show]
 Biography 
Hyarmendacil was the son of King Aldamir and reigned from TA 1540 until TA 1621. Born as Vinyarion, his father Aldamir was slain in a war with the Haradrim in TA 1540 and Vinyarion wished to avenge Aldamir's death. He accomplished this in TA 1551 by invading Harad and winning an astounding victory over the Haradrim and it was then when he proclaimed himself Hyarmendacil II, meaning in Sindarin ""South-victor"" after his famous ancestor from the twelfth century Third Age.
He died in TA 1621 after a rule of eighty-one years and two hundred thirty years of life and was succeeded by his son Minardil, who ruled for thirteen years before being slain at Pelargir.[2][3]

 Etymology 
Hyarmendacil is a Sindarin word that meant ""South-victor"".[4]

Telemnar was the twenty-sixth King of Gondor.

Contents[show]
 Biography 
Telemnar became king after his father Minardil died in an attack by the Corsairs of Umbar at Pelargir in TA 1634. Due to this renewed threat from the Corsairs, he immediately began building up Gondor's fleets to defeat them but his plans came to an end when the Great Plague struck Gondor.[1] The Great Plague ravaged Gondor and many died especially in Osgiliath and as a result King Telemnar and his immediate family died.[3] The White Tree also withered and died during this time. He was succeeded by his nephew Tarondor, who was the son of Telemnar's younger brother Minastan.[1][2]
His father's reign was brief but his own reign was even briefer. He was the shortest reigning King of Gondor, together with Isildur.

 Etymology 
The name Telemnar was a Quenya word that was likely to have come from the words telempë, meaning ""silver"", and nár, meaning ""flame"". This would give the meaning ""silver flame"" to his name.[citation needed]","

 This article is about the king of Gondor. For the king of Arnor, see Tarondor of Arnor.

Tarondor was the twenty-seventh King of Gondor.

Contents[show]
 Biography 
Tarondor was the son of Minastan succeeded his uncle Telemnar, who died in the Great Plague of TA 1636, coming to the throne when he was still young because all his cousins died and was the longest-reigning King of Gondor.
War and plague had tortured his country and Tarondor strove to rebuild it and its power. The most significant event in his reign was the removal of the capital from the now depopulated Osgiliath to Minas Anor and the replanting of the White Tree. However, Gondor at this time was drained of its resources and man-power and could no longer afford to tend to the forts guarding the ancient entrances to Mordor, thus they fell into decay paving the way for evil things to return.[3] He died in TA 1798 after one-hundred and Sixty-two years of rule was succeeded by his son Telumehtar in TA 1798.[2]

 Biography 
Telumehtar succeeded his father Tarondor as king in TA 1798. His reign was largely uneventful save for problems with the Corsairs of Umbar. The long descendents of the defeated king Castamir the Usurper; the Corsairs raided the coasts of Gondor and terrorized shipping in the area. Resolved to end the troubles, Telumehtar assembled a large force in TA 1810 and recaptured by surprise their base in Umbar. After this event he took the title Umbardacil, meaning ""Victor over Umbar"". In this war, the Corsairs suffered total defeat and the descendants of Castamir all died and Umbar was yet again held by Gondor.
Telumehtar ruled for fifty-two years and was succeeded by his son Narmacil II in TA 1850.[2]

 Etymology 
Telumehtar was a Quenyan word.[3]

In the sixth year of his brief reign, a federation of Easterlings called the Wainriders overran Gondor's territories on the eastern bank of the Anduin.

Calimehtar was the thirtieth King of Gondor.

Contents[show]
Biography
Calimehtar succeeded his father Narmacil II in TA 1856 who was killed by the Wainriders during the defeat of Gondor at the Battle of the Plains.[3][4] Calimehtar was a good friend and ally of the Éothéod. In TA 1899, the Wainriders once again became a threat to Gondor and the lands of the west. During the strife, he built the White Tower of Gondor.[4] The Éothéod leader Marhwini warned the king of the impending invasion allowing him to assemble an army in Ithilien which he marched north, also sending Cavalry over the Undeeps to harass the unguarded enemy positions there. Calimehtar and his Éothéod allies finally met the Wainriders in Dagorlad where they defeated them. Narmacil II's death had been avenged. The victory of Gondor and its allies inspired the slaves in Rhovanion to rebel against their cruel Easterling masters.[3]
He died in TA 1936 after a rule of eighty years and was succeeded by his son Ondoher.[2] He was two-hundred years of age.

Etymology
Calimehtar is a Quenya word that meant 'Swordsman of light'.[5]

Ondoher was the thirty-first King of Gondor.

Contents[show]
Biography
Ondoher as succeeded his father Calimehtar in TA 1936. His daughter Fíriel married Prince Arvedui of Arthedain.
In TA 1944, the Wainriders invaded Gondor from the east while their allies, the Haradrim, invaded Gondor from the south. Ondoher and his eldest son Artamir led the main army close to the Black Gate, where they clashed with the Wainriders. The left wing of Ondoher's army was commanded by Adrahil, the Prince of Dol Amroth. The right wing was commanded by Minothar, the captain of Gondor's armies. The center was commanded by Ondoher himself.
In the ensuing battle Ondoher was slain together with his eldest son and heir Artamir, and Gondor defeated.
The rearguard of the army defended Ithilien while Adrahil got help from General Eärnil, who had defeated the Haradrim.
Although Eärnil finally defeated the Wainriders, it was learned that Ondoher's second son Faramir (not to be confused with Faramir, brother of Boromir) was slain with his father, while law required that at least one heir should be left behind.
No-one with a valid claim to the throne could be found, and Arvedui of Arthedain claimed the throne. Although Arvedui had a strong claim by his way of his wife Fíriel, who by ancient Númenórean law now should have become Ruling Queen, the throne was granted by Steward Pelendur to the general Eärnil, who would reign as King Eärnil II.[2]
Ondoher was called Ondohir in the first edition of The Return of the King.[citation needed]","

Fíriel was a Queen of Arnor and the wife of Arvedui, the last King of Arthedain.

Contents[show]
Biography
Fíriel was the only daughter of King Ondoher of Gondor. She had two brothers, Artamir and Faramir, who were both future heirs to the southern kingdom of Gondor. Fíriel was wedded to Prince Arvedui of Arnor in TA 1940 during a time when Arvedui's father Araphant made an alliance with Ondoher. They had one son named Aranarth. The alliance came to nothing and was a failure because both of the Mannish Kingdoms were under attack: Arnor by Angmar under the Witch-king, and Gondor by the Wainriders from the East.
During the Battle of the Camp, Ondoher lost both of his sons Artamir and Faramir, and this meant that according to the Law of Númenor, Fíriel was now the Ruling Queen of Gondor. Arvedui used this to his advantage, as well as the fact that he was a direct descendant of the Númenórean nobleman Isildur. He used this argument to claim the crown of Gondor in an attempt to unite the Two Kingdoms, but this was refused by Gondor.
Fíriel remained with her husband in Arthedain, and when the kingdom fell to Angmar in TA 1974 after the Battle of Fornost, she probably fled with her son Aranarth to Lindon. Her son continued the Line of Isildur as first Chieftain of the Dúnedain in secret in the wild forests of Eriador. Her fate after her exile was not recorded but she certainly died.[2][3]

Etymology
Fíriel is a Quenya word meaning 'mortal woman'.[4]

Eärnil II was the thirty-second King of Gondor.

 Biography 
Eärnil II was selected to become king in TA 1945 after his predecessor, King Ondoher and his heirs, was slain in battle. In the previous year a two-pronged attack had been launched upon Gondor by the Haradrim and the Wainriders. In response, King Ondoher led the main army north to counter the Easterling invasion at Dagorlad and was defeated. Eärnil was commander of Gondor's southern army and guarded Pelargir. Eärnil led his army to the Crossings of the Poros where he won an astounding victory over the Haradrim. This enabled him to turn his attention to the invading Wainriders. The Wainriders, certain of victory, were celebrating their success before they would enter Minas Anor. They were unaware of Eärnil's victory in the south and were taken by surprise when Eärnil suddenly attacked them. As a result Eärnil won the Battle of the Camp.
After the threat was eliminated Gondor's attention shifted towards Steward Pelendur and the Council of Gondor, for King Ondoher along with his two sons were slain at Dagorlad. Both he and prince Arvedui of Arthedain (successor state of Arnor) claimed the throne. Arvedui based his claim on that he was the direct descendant of Isildur (second High King of Arnor and Gondor and uncle to Meneldil first King of Gondor), and as the husband of Fíriel, only surviving child of King Ondoher. The claim was rejected and Eärnil of the House of Anárion was elected king for his deeds, heritage, and because the Steward, Pelendur, claimed that ""The crown and royalty of Gondor belongs solely to the heirs of Meneldil, son of Anárion, to whom Isildur relinquished this realm. In Gondor, this heritage is reckoned through the sons only; and we have not heard that the law is otherwise in Arnor"". He reigned as Eärnil II.
Aside from being a gifted general Eärnil also was a wise ruler. He sent messages to Arvedui announcing that he received the crown of Gondor, according to the laws and the needs of the South-Kingdom, ""but I do not forget the royalty of Arnor, nor deny our kinship, nor wish that the realms of Elendil be estranged. I will send to your aid when you have need, so far as I am able."" And at last in the autumn of 1973 Third Age, messages came to Gondor that Arthedain was in great trouble, and that the Witch-king of Angmar was preparing a final stroke against it. Then Eärnil sent his son Eärnur north with a fleet, as swiftly as he could, and with as great a strength as he could spare to aid Arvedui (now king). Eärnur arrived too late to save Arthedain and Arvedui who had fled north (and was drowned in the Icebay of Forochel) but managed to defeat the kingdom of Angmar in the Battle of Fornost with the help of Círdan, the Lord of the Grey Havens and Glorfindel with an army from Rivendell. There, Eärnur earned the hatred of the Witch-king.
However, Eärnil was not able to withstand the takeover of Minas Ithil by the Ringwraiths. Minas Anor was renamed Minas Tirith (Tower of Guard) and Minas Ithil was called Minas Morgul (Tower of Sorcery).
Eärnil died in TA 2043 after a rule of ninety-eight years and was succeeded by his son Eärnur, who was as good a general as his father but lacked his wisdom, and who would be the last king before Aragorn reclaimed his throne after a long gap.[2][3]

Eärnur was the thirty-third and last King of Gondor until the restoration of the monarchy with Aragorn II Elessar. He took the throne upon the death of his father Eärnil II in TA 2043, and after his disappearance the Stewards of Gondor ruled in his name for many generations.

Biography
Eärnur was the son of Eärnil II. He was a great warrior and became a great leader of armies before he became King. His greatest victory was against Angmar in TA 1975 in the Battle of Fornost, in which he defeated the Witch-king, whom he intended to slay had his steed not panicked in terror of the Witch-king's darkness. It was to him that Glorfindel stated his prophecy that ""not by the hand of men shall he fall"" referring to the Witch-king as he fled from defeat. After becoming King in TA 2043, he was challenged by the Witch-king of Angmar, chief of the Ringwraiths, who then resided in Minas Morgul. Eärnur, being quick to anger and wrath, would have accepted his challenge had the wise Steward Mardil Voronwë not held him back, and so the first challenge went unanswered. In TA 2050 a second challenge came, mocking Eärnur, and Mardil was not able to stop Eärnur from accepting the challenge. After entering the gates of Minas Morgul with a small escort, Eärnur was never heard from again. His crown lay on his father's tomb in the Hallows of Minas Tirith.
The Line of Anárion was broken with Eärnur's dissappearance, and the rule of Gondor passed to the Stewards, beginning with Mardil Voronwë, who had tried to restrain Eärnur from going to Minas Morgul to face the Witch-king. The Stewards were to rule ""until the King returns"", for it was then unknown whether Eärnur had been killed dueling the Witch-king or not. Eärnur had also left without naming an heir, and while many nobles in Gondor could lay some sort of claim to the kingship, those claims were held in doubt, and no one wanted to risk a second civil war.[2]

 Personality 
Eärnur did not inherit his father's wisdom; he delighted mainly in battle, and desired no wife.[2]

Etymology
Eärnur was a Quenya word that meant ""Sea-friend"".

Dúnedain of the North (House of Isildur)



Argeleb II was the tenth King of Arthedain. He is best remembered as being the one responsible for creating the Shire for the Hobbits.

 Biography 
Argeleb was the son of King Araphor of Arthedain, and was named for his great-grandfather Argeleb I. He came to the throne in TA 1589 at the death of his father. During his rule the Great Plague reached Eriador, and most of the people of Cardolan perished, especially in Minhiriath.[3] The Hobbits and other peoples living in Arnor all suffered greatly, but the plague lessened as it went north, and the north of Arthedain was scarcely affected. Still it saw the end of Cardolan, and the last prince of Cardolan was buried in the Barrow-downs in the same mound Frodo Baggins was later caught in. Evil spirits sent by Angmar passed through Rhudaur to Cardolan, and began to dwell in the Barrow-downs.
Perhaps because of the loss of population, he granted the Shire to the Hobbits. Before these lands had been a royal hunting ground. Argeleb was succeeded at his death in TA 1670 by his son Arvegil after a rule of eighty-one years.[2]

Finrod, also known fully as Finrod Felagund, was a Ñoldorin Elf who was born in Aman, He was King of Nargothrond and the eldest son of Finarfin and Eärwen, and the brother of Galadriel, Angrod and Aegnor.[2] Finrod was one of the noblest elves of the House of Finarfin and a friend of Men. His nobility and death saving Beren and his opposition to the Oath of Fëanor allowed for his return to life in Valinor, making him the first Elf to be reincarnated in the Undying Lands before the end of the First Age.

 Biography 
Finrod was friendly with Turgon and the House of Fingolfin. He opposed Fëanor and the Oath when he sought to return to Middle-earth to recover the Silmarils from Morgoth, but chose not to be parted with his friends and so he followed his father and his House and the House of Fingolfin. Finrod did not fight in the Kinslaying of Alqualondë nor was he aware of it as he continued the transit through Araman. While marching up the coast, the host encountered a figure on a rock and heard the Prophecy of the North. Afterwards, Finarfin and many of his followers departed and returned to Tirion, but Finrod chose to continue onto Middle-earth with the host of Fingolfin.[3]
Finrod founded the original Minas Tirith in the Pass of Sirion. In around FA 50, he and his friend Turgon, while journeying down the river Sirion, encamped along its banks and were laid to rest by Ulmo. While asleep, Ulmo revealed to them the hidden realm of Nargothrond and the valley of Tumladen. Finrod discovered the system of caves beneath the Taur-en-Faroth, and with the help from the Dwarves of the Blue Mountains  he starts to build Nargothrond and went on to found his own kingdom and became King of Nargothrond.[4][5] Finrod rewarded the Dwarves with many jewels from Valinor. And in that time they made for him the Nauglamír and gave him the honorific Felagund meaning  ""Hewer of Caves"".

    ""Finrod. First encounter with Edain"" by EKukanova  
While hunting in the lands of Thargelion in East Beleriand, Finrod was first of the Ñoldor to come across Men. He stayed with them long, learning their language and teaching them Sindarin. He also intervened on behalf of the Laiquendi of Ossiriand, who feared Men would destroy their home, and he received the permission of King Thingol, who held rule over all Beleriand, to guide the Men to Estolad.[6]
Finrod had a close friendship with Andreth of the House of Bëor, whom he often visited during the Siege of Angband to converse with her on the matters of Elves and Men. One such conversation was written down and later known as Athrabeth Finrod ah Andreth.
During the Dagor Bragollach, Barahir of the House of Bëor saved Finrod's life, and in friendship Finrod gave him his ring.[7] This ring was later known as the Ring of Barahir and was eventually handed down to Aragorn when told of his true identity. Years after the Dagor Bragollach, Barahir's son Beren came to Nargothrond seeking help, and Finrod went with him on the Quest of the Silmaril to repay his debt, laying down his kingship. Celegorm and Curufin, who were living in Nargothrond at the time, persuaded (using fear of Morgoth, and barely veiled threats related to their Oath) most of Nargothrond to stay behind; only ten warriors, headed by one, Edrahil, were faithful and accompanied their King.[8]
Though disguised by the arts of Finrod, the twelve were captured by Sauron and taken to 

    and he died in the dark, in Tol-in-Gaurhoth, whose great tower he himself had built. Thus King Finrod Felagund, the fairest and most beloved of the house of Finwë, redeemed his oath.  
Tol-in-Gaurhoth, formerly Minas Tirith, the castle Felagund himself had built. Finrod and Sauron battled with songs of power but despite a great display of skill and power by the Elven prince, Sauron eventually caught him in a devious trap and prevailed. But Sauron could not discern who exactly they were, even though they were revealed to him. Sauron imprisoned them, seeking to learn their errand and identities, sending a werewolf to devour them one by one until they revealed their secret, yet none did. Sauron however perceived that Finrod was a High Elven Lord of great power, and purposed to save him for last. Eventually, when the wolf came for Beren, Finrod burst his chains and killed the wolf barehanded but was mortally wounded himself.[8]    Finrod swore an oath of abiding friendship and aid in every need to Barahir and all his kin  Finrod loved Amarië, a Vanyarin Elf, who didn't follow him to Middle-earth. For this, though she and Finrod were betrothed, Finrod never married while in Middle-earth.[9] It is noted in the Lay of Leithian that Finrod was soon allowed to return to life in Valinor and ""now dwells with Amarië"" and was described as walking ""with Finarfin his father beneath the trees in Eldamar"".[8] Even though Mandos foretold that any of the exiles who died would never be allowed to leave his halls, Finrod alone was allowed to reembody in Valinor.
""...They buried the body of Felagund upon the hill-top of his own isle, and it was clean again; and the green grave of Finrod Finarfin's son, fairest of all the princes of the Elves, remained inviolate, until the land was changed and broken, and foundered under destroying seas. But Finrod walks with Finarfin his father beneath the trees in Eldamar."" - The Silmarillion

 Etymology 
The name Finrod is a Sindarin form of his Telerin (Quenya) name Findaráto, with the approximate meaning ""Mighty descendant of Finwë"". His mother name is Ingoldo (""the Ñoldo"").[10]
Felagund is an Epessë given to him by the Dwarves that expanded the caves of Nargothrond. It is actually of Dwarvish origin (or Sindarized Khuzdul) from the word felak-gundu (""Hewer of Caves"").[11]
Finrod was also called by Bëor and his people Nóm ('Wisdom'), Nómin ('the Wise'), and ""Friend-of-Men"", which in Elvish was Edennil and Atandil, Sindarin and Quenya respectively.[6][11]

 Titles 
King of Nargothrond

The earlier name for Finrod, as told in The History of Middle-earth, was Inglor Felagund.

 Biography 
    Amrod taking The Oath of Fëanor with his brothers, by Jenny Dolfen  
Amrod and his brother Amras were born sometime during the Years of the Trees in Valinor. During the rebellion of the Ñoldor, Amrod and his brothers swore the Oath of Fëanor.[3] Before they left for Middle-earth, Nerdanel Amrod's mother begged Fëanor to leave her two youngest son with him or at least one of them. Fëanor refused her, and Nerdanel prophesied that one of them will not set foot on Middle-earth.[4]
In accordance to The Silmarillion, Amrod did not die during the Burning of the ships at Losgar. In this version, Amrod and his six brothers rescued their father during the Dagor-nuin-Giliath.[5] He had also held the lands of Estolad with his brother.[6] In FA 538, Amrod and Amras died during the Third Kinslaying at the Havens of Sirion.[7]

 Etymology 
Amrods father-name is Telufinwë ""Last Finwë"", most likely from the Quenyan tella (""hindmost, last"").[8] The short form of this name is Telvo. Originally, his mother-name was Ambarussa ""Top-russet"", from amba (""upwards""). When Fëanor insisted on different names for the twins, Nerdanel called Amrod Umbarto, ""the Fated"". Fëanor later changed it to Ambarto, ""Upwards-exalted"", from amba and arta (""exalted, lofty"").[4]

 Earlier names 
In earlier versions, Amrod was given the name Damrod and his brother Amras was named Diriel.[9]

 Other Names 
In Old English, Amrod's name is Deormod ""the Brave-hearted"".[10]

Ñoldor (House of Finwë)



Finarfin was a Ñoldorin Elf of Valinor.
He was said to be the fairest and wisest of Finwë's sons.[5] Like all of Finwë's sons, Finarfin founded his own royal house. Uniquely among the Ñoldor, he and his descendants all had golden hair inherited from his Vanyarin mother Indis, thus his house was sometimes called ""The Golden House of Finarfin"".[6]

 Biography 
    Finarfin and Eärwen, by Līga Kļaviņa  
Finarfin was the youngest child and third son of Finwë, High-King of the Noldor in Aman, with his second wife Indis of the Vanyar. His elder siblings were Findis, Fingolfin, and Írimë while his elder half-brother was the infamous Noldorin High-prince Fëanor who was the eldest son of Finarfin's father Finwë, In YT 1280,[2] Finarfin married Eärwen, a princess of the Teleri being the daughter of Olwë, King of the Teleri, which made him thus related to the kin of Thingol (Elwë), King of Doriath who was the brother of Olwë. Together, they had four (five) children: Finrod Felagund, Orodreth (according to the published Silmarillion) Angrod, Aegnor, and an only daughter Galadriel who was the youngest child.[5]
After the death of Finwë, when Fëanor gave his wrathful speech before the Ñoldor of Tirion, Finarfin was there, and listening to the hasty words, he tried in vain to persuade the Ñoldor to pause and not to be rash. Nevertheless, he departed with his brothers Fëanor and Fingolfin for Middle-earth but turned back when Mandos pronounced the Doom of the Ñoldor. Finarfin and his people were pardoned by the Valar,[7] and then he became King of the residual Ñoldor in Aman and presumably still rules from Tirion on Túna.[1][8]
Finarfin took part in the War of Wrath by leading the Ñoldorin-remnant from Aman. [9]

 Etymology 
His father-name is Arafinwë, the ""Noble-Finwë"", from the Quenya ara (""noble, high, royal"").[10][11] His amilessë (mother-name) is Ingoldo (""the Ñoldo"").[1]

 Other names 
An Old English translation for his name was Finred Felanop, in which ""Felanop"" means ""very bold"".[12]

 Descendants 
Through Galadriel, he is the grandfather of Lady Celebrian of Rivendell (wife of Elrond), and consequently, the great-grandfather of her three children Elladan and Elrohir, and Arwen Undómiel, future Queen of Gondor. [1]

Saruman: ""My fighting Uruk-hai... ...whom do you serve?""Lurtz: ""Saruman!""
—The Fellowship of the Ring (film)


Lurtz was the first leader of the Uruk-hai scouts created specifically for Peter Jackson's movie The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring. He was portrayed by New Zealand actor Lawrence Makoare in the first film, Fellowship of the Ring, in which he kills Boromir, and is later slain by Aragorn.
He is non-canonical as he was created for the films, and is not in the books. He was also in one of the most memorable shots of the first movie.

Contents[show]
 Portrayal in adaptations 
 Peter Jackson's The Lord of the Rings film trilogy 
    Lurtz making his allegiance with Saruman, some time after being bred  
Lurtz was the first of Saruman's Uruk-hai to be bred, choking the first Orc he sees to death within seconds of his birth. Attempting to intervene, other Orcs (Snaga) move towards the newly born Uruk-hai warrior, but Saruman halts their advance, intrigued by the malice and violence present in the Uruk's blood, leaving the unfortunate Orc to its fate. He became Saruman's second-in-command, and led the first battalion of Uruk-hai into battle against the Fellowship of the Ring at Amon Hen. Lurtz was born from the first group of Uruk-hai in Isengard's pits.

 Hunt for the Ring-bearer 
    Lurtz about to kill Boromir  
In the book-series, Boromir was slain by Orc archers, described as having been ""pierced by many arrows"". In the movie, he was killed by Lurtz, who shoots him three times in the shoulder, stomach, and chest after chasing the Fellowship of the Ring to Parth Galen.
As his soldiers grab Merry and Pippin, Lurtz slowly approaches Boromir to finish him off. Before Lurtz can send the final arrow to Boromir's heart, Aragorn intervenes, tackling Lurtz to the ground, and both begin engaging in a brutal fight.
During the struggle, Lurtz's incredible ferocity and brutality appear to rival Aragorn's skill and resourcefulness. Lurtz throws his shield at Aragorn, pinning him to a tree, but Aragorn escapes and physically brawls with him. Lurtz outmatches him, so Aragorn stabs him through the leg with a knife, only for Lurtz to pull it out, lick the blood off it and throw it at him. Aragorn deflects the knife with his sword and charges. The two clash in an intense sword-fight, before Aragorn severs Lurtz's right arm and stabs him in the stomach. While pierced by Aragorn's weapon, Lurtz grabs hold of Aragorn's blade and pulls the sword deeper into his stomach, (feeling no pain, for in the movie Saruman says that Uruk-hai ""do not know pain"") while dragging Aragorn closer in a final attempt to kill him. Before Lurtz can attempt to kill the Ranger with his teeth, Aragorn pulls his sword out of the Uruk leader's chest and decapitates him, finally killing him.

    Aragorn stabs Lurtz  
Boromir dies minutes later. In the book, Uglúk was the leader of the Orc-band from the beginning, with no mention of Lurtz at all. (The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring and The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring Special Extended Edition)

 Character 
Of all Uruk-hai bred in Isengard, Lurtz was probably the smartest, and bravest, and the most capable leader. He is highly intelligent, extremely violent and blindly loyal to Saruman. The only notable personality trait he displays is a high tolerance to pain, although he noticeably growls in pain when Aragorn stabs him through the leg with his dagger and when he pulls the dagger out of his leg, but doesn't feel it when his arm is sliced off. When stabbed through the stomach, he pulls the sword deeper into his body, closer to Aragorn to taunt him and in a last ditched effort to kill him - this shows that Lurtz has ultimate perseverance and tolerance for the odds.
He was a highly skilled swordsman who had an unorthodox, brute fighting style involving long-range attacks and close-range brawling moves. He held his own against Aragorn, managing to keep up with him for a period of time, landing several blows upon him and even making him bleed. However, he was eventually overpowered and slain by Aragorn due to the latter's superior skill and technique. Lurtz also had the skill of an archer.
Lurtz's name is never spoken aloud in the original film; it is only known from the franchise and credits. However, in the extended edition of the film, Lurtz's name is spoken by Saruman.

 Video games 
    Lurtz in BFME II  
The character of Lurtz is one of the playable ""heroes"" for the Isengard faction in the strategy game The Lord of the Rings: The Battle for Middle-earth and its sequel The Lord of the Rings: The Battle for Middle-earth II, and ironically doesn't appear in any The Fellowship of the Ring video games. He also appears as a playable character in the RPG's The Lord of the Rings: Conquest and LEGO The Lord of the Rings after he is unlocked.
He made an appearance in The Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers video game as one of the bosses in the level Amon hen.
Lurtz makes an appearance in the GBA Game The Lord of the Rings: The Third Age as a playable hero for the forces of evil.

 Toys 
In the LEGO game Battle of Helm's Deep, a Lurtz microfigure is presented, named ""Uruk-hai Leader"". 
In LEGO The Lord of the Rings: The Video Game, there is a playable character actually named ""Lurtz"" along with his newborn variation obtained through obtaining 100% completion. In this game, Lurtz kills Boromir by throwing a banana in his chest. 

The LEGO kit ""The Orc Forge"" includes the Lurtz minifigure, alone of all LEGO kits.     LEGO Lurtz  
 Trivia 
Lurtz was played by New Zealand actor Lawrence Makoare. Such was the size of Lawrence, that he did not have to wear the extensive amounts of padding as the other Uruk-hai actors did, needing only the minimum to give him the features of an Uruk-hai warrior.
Because Lawrence Makoare's vision was impaired while he was made-up to look like Lurtz, he could not pull punches during the sequence when he battles Aragorn in hand-to-hand-combat. Rather than having Makoare do the sequence over until he could pull his punches, Viggo Mortensen decided to fight back just as realistically - making the physical blows completely real.
The Uruk-hai make-up also caused Makoare to throw Aragorn's dagger directly back at Viggo, even though he was supposed to try and miss. Viggo managed to deflect the knife with his sword, which made it into the final cut of the film.

 In The Battle for Middle-earth, Lurtz has the ability to shoot an enemy hero with an arrow that roots them to the ground, much like Boromir's inability to move after being shot by him in the film.

""Glorfindel was tall and straight; his hair was of shining gold, his face fair and young and fearless and full of joy; his eyes were bright and clean, and his voice like music; on his brow set wisdom, and in his hand was strength.""
—The Lord of the Rings, The Fellowship of the Ring, Many Meetings

Glorfindel was one of the mighty of the Firstborn (the Elves), and was once the lord of the House of the Golden Flower in Gondolin. After his death, he was re-embodied by the Valar to act as an emissary.

Contents[show]
 Biography 
 Years of the Trees 
Glorfindel was born in Tirion sometime during the Noontide of Valinor, and was descended from a house of princes.[4] He followed the House of Fingolfin during the Flight of the Ñoldor, but he took no part in the Kinslaying at Alqualondë.

 First Age 
    Glorfindel's banner  
After the exile, Glorfindel followed Turgon to Gondolin. He was appointed as the Lord of the House of the Golden Flower and one of the captains of the King. He was popular and well-loved by the Gondolindrim.
When Aredhel wished to depart Gondolin in search for the Sons of Fëanor, Turgon appointed Glorfindel, Ecthelion, and Egalmoth to be her escorts. They were denied entrance to Doriath, and instead turned north where the escort lost Aredhel near Nan Dungortheb. They later returned to Gondolin without her.[5]
Along with King Turgon, Glorfindel fought in the Nírnaeth Arnoediad, holding the King's flanks as they retreated towards the Pass of Sirion.[6][7]

 Fall of Gondolin 
    Glorfindel and Ecthelion, by Jenny Dolfen  
In FA 510, the forces of Melkor attacked Gondolin, with the help of Maeglin's treachery. Glorfindel and the last of his followers held the Great Market from the Orcs, in pursuance of ambushing the enemies. However, they themselves were ambushed and fought until a fire-drake arrived. Glorfindel and his people cut their way out, but were pursed by the orcs. The House of the Harp arrived to help them, after disobeying their deceitful lord, Salgant. The House of the Golden Flower regrouped at the Square of the King and was one of the last Houses to fight.[2]


    Glorfindel and the Balrog, by Eric Velhagen   
Glorfindel joined Tuor in defending the Square, until Egalmoth arrived and Ecthelion was slain during his fight with Gothmog. When King Turgon was also slain, the Gondolindrim escaped through Idril's Secret Way, with Glorfindel holding the rear manfully and lost more of his followers there.[2]
As they made their escape through Cirith Thoronath, one of the Balrogs came upon the refugees. Glorfindel leapt forward to face the Balrog, while his followers watched from afar. He fended himself from the Balrog's whip and claws, and successfully hewed its iron helm. At the last moment, he pierced the Balrog's belly and it fell backwards towards the cliff, but it grabbed Glorfindel by his hair and both of them fell into the deep abyss. His body was later borne up by Thorondor, Lord of Eagles, who flew down into the Abyss to rescue Glorfindel's broken body, returning it to his people who buried him high on the cliffs of the Mountains which surrounded Gondolin. It was said that yellow flowers (possibly celandine) grew on his mound, despite its rocky location.[2]

 Second Age 
 Return to Middle-earth 
Glorfindel's spirit departed to the Halls of Mandos, where he spent years with the spirits of the others who died. Due to his noble actions, valor and bravery that saved many Elves during the Fall of Gondolin, he was re-embodied after a short time.
A thousand years later, in SA 1600, Manwë sent him back to Middle-earth as an emissary of the Valar and granted him powers nearly as strong as that of the Maiar's.[8]

 Third Age 
It is possible that Glorfindel remained for a time in Lindon along with the other noble Elves, such as Gil-galad, Círdan, and Elrond, a descendant of Tuor and Idril.

 Battle of Fornost 
Do not pursue him! He will not return to this land. Far off yet is his doom, and not by the hand of man will he fall.—Glorfindel's prophecy about the Witch-king[9]

    The Battle of Fornost, by Jan Pospíšil  
During the Battle of Fornost, Glorfindel was the major reason the evil Witch-king of Angmar was defeated. After the battle was over, and the Witch-king had fled, it was Glorfindel who predicted that no mortal man would ever destroy the Witch-king.[9] This prediction would come true a thousand years later at the Battle of the Pelennor Fields, when Éowyn of Rohan (a woman) and Meriadoc Brandybuck (a Hobbit) destroyed the Witch-king.[10]

 War of the Ring 
Suddenly into view below came a white horse, gleaming in the shadows, running swiftly. In the dusk its headstall flickered and flashed, as if it were studded with gems like living stars. The rider's cloak streamed behind him, and his hood was thrown back; his golden hair flowed shimmering in the wind of his speed.... it appeared that white light was shining through the form and raiment of the rider, as if though through a thin veil.—The Lord of the Rings, The Fellowship of the Ring, Flight to the Ford

    Glorfindel and the Nazgûl  
A thousand years later, Glorfindel was sent by Lord Elrond to search for Frodo and his companions. He pursued some of the Nazgûl and drew them away from the Ford of Bruinen. He then found and led the company for days stopping only briefly to let the Hobbits rest. When the Nazgul approached again, Glorfindel put Frodo on his white horse Asfaloth, and bade the horse take Frodo to Rivendell. Asfaloth outran the black horses of the Nazgûl and managed to cross the Ford of Bruinen which led to Rivendell. A severely weakened Frodo, conscious but delirious due to the wound he was carrying from the Morgul-knife, turned back to defy the Riders who pleaded for him to come with them. The Nazgul entered the shallow ford but were there un-horsed and swept away by a torrent of enchanted water which guarded the entrance to Imladris charged with the power of the Half-elven and indeed by Gandalf the Grey.[11] He later led the injured Frodo and the rest of the company safely to Rivendell.
At the Council of Elrond, Glorfindel sat in a position of honour alongside Elrond and Gandalf. He suggested that the One Ring should be either sent to Tom Bombadil and cast into the depths of the Sea, but Gandalf believed that the One may resurface on land after a hundred or thousand years. He was briefly considered to be a member of the Fellowship of the Ring, but was later ruled out: his power would be of no use in a mission of secrecy to Mordor.[12]

 After the War 
After the Ring's destruction, Glorfindel, along with Erestor and the sons of Elrond, witnessed the wedding of Aragorn and Arwen.[13] His ultimate fate is not known, but it is reasonable to assume that he eventually sailed to Valinor with the rest of his kin.

 Character 
    Glorfindel, by Magali Villenueve  
Glorfindel was known for his golden hair, which at some point, was described to be yellow. He was an elf of great bodily, nobility, heroism and spiritual structure, wisdom, and bravery. The Gondolindrim loved him dearly and wept upon witnessing his passing at Cirith Thoronath.[2] He was a capable leader, as seen when he led his House during the Fall, and loyal to his King and brothers-in-arms. He was very courageous and mindful of the refugees as they escaped. He chose to protect all the escaping Gondolindrim (especially Tuor and Idril), though he ""would have defended them even had they been fugitives of any rank"".[8] He displayed more of his power and courage when he faced against the Nine Riders to save Frodo, and when he participated in the Council of Elrond.


 Powers 
Glorfindel was a very capable fighter, with great endurance; he fought for hours during the Fall of Gondolin and managed to face against a Balrog on his own.[2]
After his re-embodiment, Manwë had given Glorfindel powers nearly equal to the Maiar's, to help him in his missions in Middle-earth.[8] He was considered one of the most powerful elves from Rivendell, given by his powerful and almost ""angelic"" presence, which had made the Black Riders flee many times.[9] He also had medicinal knowledge, as seen when he tends to Frodo's wounds.[11]

 Etymology 
His original name is said to have been Laurefindil, which is the Quenya for ""Golden-haired"", from laurë (""golden"") and findilë (""head of hair"").[14] Glorfindel is simply the Sindarin translation of Laurefindil, from glaur (""golden"") and fîn or find (""lock of hair"").[15][16]

 Parentage 
Glorfindel was said to be descended from a house of princes and one of the noble elves in Gondolin. Due to his golden hair, he might be descended from a Ñoldorin-Vanyarin intermarriage, like Finrod and Galadriel. His loyalty and following Turgon also indicated that he could be one of Turgon's kin, despite Turgon and the House of Fingolfin having dark hair. In The Complete Guide to Middle-earth, it is suggested that Glorfindel is a member of the House of Finarfin.[17]

 Other versions of the legendarium 
In Tolkien's early drafts, there were two Glorfindels: a Glorfindel of Gondolin and a Glorfindel of Rivendell. These two were initially thought to be different individuals. While writing The Lord of the Rings, Tolkien borrowed a name from one of the earlier elves. As the legendarium grew more diverse, however, Tolkien decided that an elf who had fought in many wars might be a good companion for Gandalf. He explained in The Last Writings that the Glorfindel of Gondolin and Glorfindel of Rivendell are one and the same:
He then became again a living incarnate person, but was permitted to dwell in the Blessed Realm; for he had regained the primitive innocence and grace of the Eldar. For long years he remained in Valinor, in reunion with the Eldar who had not rebelled, and in the companionship of the Maiar. To these he had now become almost an equal, for though he was an incarnate (to whom a bodily form not made or chosen by himself was necessary) his spiritual power had been greatly enhanced by his self-sacrifice.—The History of Middle-earth, The Last Writings, Glorfindel
Upon deciding Glorfindel's return to Middle-earth, Tolkien came up with three options regarding Glorfindel's return to Middle-earth: SA 1200 (during Annatar's appearance in Númenor), SA 1600 (the completion of Barad-dûr), or TA 1000 (with the five Istari). Although all were probable, Tolkien favoured the SA 1600 date.[8]
In the first draft of The Council of Elrond, Glorfindel was among of what was to become the Fellowship of the Ring, along with Durin son of Balin (who later became Gimli son of Gloin) and Trotter (later named Strider or Aragorn).[18]

 Portrayal in adaptations 
Glorfindel was left out of Ralph Bakshi's version of the Lord of the Rings, with Legolas in place of him when Aragorn was supposed to meet him before the attack at the Ford of Bruinen.

 Lord of the Rings film trilogy 
In The Fellowship of the Ring, Glorfindel's role in guiding Frodo Baggins to Rivendell is filled by Arwen, though he does appear during the prologue when Sauron is defeated. In The Return of the King, Glorfindel is seen walking next to Arwen as she is having her vision of her son Eldarion during the journey to The Grey Havens. In his last appearance, he is seen at the crowning of King Elessar, behind Legolas and in front of Arwen. In all appearances in the movies he has no speaking lines.

 Radio versions 
He was included in the BBC's Lord of the Rings radio serial in 1981 and was voiced by John Webb.

 Video games 

    Glorfindel in The Lord of the Rings: The Battle for Middle-earth II.  
In this non-canon computer game, Battle for Middle-earth II, Glorfindel is the first hero the player commands in the good campaign. He is depicted with silver armour and a sword. His powers include the ability to mount his horse ""Asfaloth"" and the ability to heal and strengthen allied warriors. It should also be noted that Glorfindel has silver hair even though he is actually supposed to have golden hair (and his name means gold-haired).
Glorfindel, with the dwarf leader Gloin, is sent to muster the Dwarves to fight against Sauron. While Glorfindel and Gloin make their travels, however, they also make astounding and important victories against the Goblins, driving them out and clearing the roads to impede Sauron's control over the North.
Mission 1, Rivendell

    Glorfindel meeting the Dwarf Gloin in the BFME campaign  
The mission begins when Glorfindel, along with a few Lorien Warriors, make their way to Rivendell to warn Arwen Undómiel of the approaching Goblins. Along the way, they encounter and slay many Goblins, which is disturbing because Goblins have never been sighted this close to Rivendell before. Once making his way to Elrond, Glorfindel warns him of the approaching Goblins. In response, more warriors are trained in Barracks to repel the assault. After waves of Goblins, a Cave Troll, and a Mountain Giant attack and fail to break the Elven defenses, Arwen arrives with Rivendell Lances and Lorien Archers. Eagles also join the fight. With these new forces, the Elven leaders direct the Elves to destroy the Goblin camp. Under Glorfindel's mighty sword, no Goblins survive and the camp is destroyed. A Wyrm then appears, but Glorfindel repeatedly strikes at it, and the combined efforts of the Elves bring the Wyrm down, leaving victory with the Elves.
Mission 2, High Pass

    Glorfindel gather his forces against their enemies.  
To prevent further invasions on Rivendell, Glorfindel and Gloin set out for the High Pass to rally the Dwarves and eliminate the Goblins. After a sturdy base is created, Glorfindel sets out on the High Pass with new Elven Warriors and Gloin. While journeying, they destroy any Goblin sentries and lairs that they find. Towards the end of the High Pass, they find Haldir under ambush from Goblins, and Glorfindel defeats the Goblins to rescue his friend. Together, they make their way to the Goblin base on the other side of the pass. Although a Watcher in the Water appears and attacks, Glorfindel defeats it with the help of his forces. The rest of the Goblins are then routed out, and complete victory goes to the Elves.
Mission 3, Ettenmoors
The Goblins have a new leader, Gorkil and Glorfindel and Gloin decide to lead their forces to attack the Goblin King and slay him, rendering the Goblins demoralized and confused. Upon arriving, Glorfindel learns that an Elven settlement is under attack from Goblins. Outraged, he leads his remaining forces from the High Pass to save the settlement and drive the Goblins away once and for all while Haldir gets reinforcements. Glorfindel and his forces (including Gloin) drive the Goblins away from the settlement, and prepare a base to assist their assault. Once the necessary preparations have been made, the Elven forces (with Haldir's reinforcements) set out to free a dormant Ent and destroy the Goblin King's stronghold, laying waste to an Ettenmoors drum, Goblin settlements, and sentry towers. They soon free the Ent Moot, and call forth the mighty Ent Treebeard to aid them. The assault upon the Goblin King's lair now begins in full swing. Despite heavy resistance from Goblins and their Giant and Troll allies, the fortress is taken and the Goblin King slain.
Soon after, Glorfindel and Gloin free a lone Dwarf prisoner who tells them that the Blue Mountains are under attack from Drogoth the Dragon Lord, and quickly rush to the Blue Mountains to aid their allies.
Mission 4, Blue Mountains

    Glorfindel, Elrond and Men's King Earnur unite against the Witch-King of Angmar.  
Glorfindel and Gloin arrive with a few Elves, but are attacked by Drogoth. They and their Dwarven warriors flee to the inside of cave. They quickly eliminate spiders that are inside the cave, and then build a mighty base in it. After resting and preparing their armies, they march upon the Blue Mountains to slay Drogoth. Many Goblin spider riders, spiders, and Fire Drakes attempt to defeat them, but the army eventually makes it to the throne room, where Drogoth awaits. Upon encountering him, the Mirkwood Archers and Dwarven Axethrowers immediately fire upon him, eventually slaying him.
With Drogoth defeated, the Blue Mountains are free and Sauron's hold is further lessened. However, Glorfindel and Gloin are astonished to learn that the Dwarves refuse to help them. They then make their way to the Grey Havens, hoping for a better reception from the Elves.
Mission 5, the Grey Havens
Glorfindel and Gloin, upon arriving at the Grey Havens, immediately sense that something is wrong. They rush to the city to discover that the Corsairs are attacking the structures in the city. While some Dwarven Axethrowers return to the Blue Mountains to alert the Dwarves, Glorfindel and the Elves destroy the Corsairs. Afterwards, they recreate their armada and prepare to counterattack the Corsair fleet. After the naval blockade is removed, Glorfindel sends some Elves to capture the Corsair shipwrights.
After these shipwrights are captured, the Corsair (and Goblin) armada begins its assault. Glorfindel, Gloin, and the Elves rush to the beach to intercept the assault, with the help of the Elven ships. The Dwarves arrive after the first wave is destroyed, and, after two more waves, the forces of Evil are destroyed. Glorfindel cements the alliance between Dwarf and Elf, and Arwen arrives with news of an invasion into Mirkwood. Glorfindel and Gloin ride on Eagles to defend Thranduil's kingdom.

In the 1978 film of The Lord of the Rings, Glorfindel's part was taken by Legolas when leading the Hobbits and Strider to Rivendell.

At one stage Tolkien considered whether Glorfindel was one of the Blue Wizards, but he later decided against this.

In July 2007, 3-D entertainment model producer Gentle Giant Studios, Inc., headquartered in Burbank, California, released an exclusive sculpted Glorfindel bust, limited to 500 pieces, for the 2007 San Diego Comic-Con.

 Biography 
 Early Life 
Glóin was born in TA 2783, after Erebor, after the Dragon Smaug desolated Erebor. He was the younger child of Gróin and younger brother of Óin.
In TA 2799, Glóin was known to have fought in the Battle of Azanulbizar, the last battle of the War of the Dwarves and Orcs, though it is unknown what significance he did, being 16 years old.
In TA 2879, in the Blue Mountains, while in exile, his son Gimli was born to him and an unknown wife. In March of TA 2941 in Bree, Thorin Oakenshield met by chance the wizard Gandalf the Grey, pushing Thorin to reclaim Erebor, so that Smaug wouldn't start an alliance with Sauron, when Gandalf mentioned hobbits, Glóin referred them as ""simpletons"" and also said that hobbits ""would never dare to come within smelling distance of the nakedest dragonet new from the shell"". 

 Quest for Erebor 
In TA 2941, Glóin and his brother Óin, along with his cousins Dwalin and Balin, were among the Dwarves accompanying Thorin and Company during their quest to the Lonely Mountain to recapture The Kingdom of Erebor from the Dragon Smaug. He was noted for his skills with a tinderbox, and, along with his brother Óin, was usually the one told to get a fire started whenever the Dwarves made camp. Gloin also fought in the Battle of the Five Armies.[1] After the battle, he returned to the Lonely Mountain.

 War of the Ring 
On October 25, 3018, Glóin and his son Gimli attended the Council of Elrond in Rivendell, where he greeted Frodo Baggins at the welcome dinner, after Frodo had recovered from his wounds received from the Witch-king of Angmar. He recounted the history of the Lonely Mountain and the Kingdom of Dale since Bilbo had left, including Balin's decision to leave the Lonely Mountain and reestablish the ancient Dwarven kingdom in Moria. At the Council of Elrond, his son Gimli warned of the messengers from Mordor who had been threatening King Dain II Ironfoot, and seeking news of Bilbo, Frodo, and the One Ring. t is unknown whether he had fought against Sauron's forces in the Battle of Dale.

 Later Life 
Glóin died in FO 15 at the age of 253.[2] It is unknown that after the War of the Ring, if he saw Gimli again, as Gimili did return to Erebor after visiting Fangorn Forest and the Glittering Caves.

Balin was a Dwarf leader, the son of Fundin, and elder brother of Dwalin. He was one of the thirteen Dwarves who accompanied Thorin II Oakenshield on the quest to regain the Lonely Mountain.
A Dwarf Lord known for his wise counsel and willingness to listen, he was one of Thorin's closest friends and advisers. Balin was distantly related to him, and a descendant of the noble house of Durin.
He later went to re-establish the kingdom of Moria, but within five years it was overcome once more by Orcs, and he was killed there along with the rest of his companions.

 Biography 
 Early life 
Balin was likely born in the Lonely Mountain before the coming of the dragon Smaug. He had a younger brother named Dwalin, and was amongst those driven from their homes when Smaug attacked the Lonely Mountain. Afterwards, he may have lived in Dunland as a refugee, before fighting in the War of the Dwarves and Orcs which culminated in the Battle of Azanulbizar. Many years later, in approximately TA 2841, he accompanied Thráin II, the father of Thorin, when he attempted to go back to the Lonely Mountain himself, but Thráin was captured and lost.[1]

 Quest for Erebor 
Balin was part of the company assembled by Thorin Oakenshield in TA 2941 that journeyed to the Lonely Mountain with Bilbo Baggins and Gandalf to defeat Smaug, and to retake the kingdom of Erebor. He was the second Dwarf to arrive at Bilbo's house, where, like his brother Dwalin, he played a viol as big as himself.[2] Following the meeting's conclusion and the company's initial departure to the Green Dragon Inn, Balin spotted Bilbo hurrying to reach them before they set out.[3]

    Balin visits Bilbo in The Hobbit films  
Balin, along with his companions, underwent the journey through the Trollshaws and Lone-lands to Rivendell, including the encounter with the trolls Tom, Bert, and William.[3] The company rested in Rivendell for some time, and after setting out to cross the Misty Mountains, were captured by orcs on the High Pass, after taking refuge from a thunderstorm.[4] With Gandalf's help, the dwarves escaped, and subsequently Balin was posted as a lookout when Bilbo returned, having been separated from the company during their flight. Due to Bilbo's usage of the One Ring, which he had discovered in the orc tunnels, the hobbit crept by Balin unnoticed, puzzling the dwarf a great deal. Soon afterwards, the company was beset by wargs, which forced them to climb a number of pine trees until their rescue by the Great Eagles.[5]
The Eagles took them to their eyrie, and then to the Carrock, from whence the company traveled to the house of Beorn.[5] Gandalf decided to introduce the dwarves by pairs so as not to overwhelm Beorn, and Balin and Dwalin were chosen to come first. Having been welcomed by the skin-changer and given rest and provisions, the company set out to cross the forest of Mirkwood.[6] Despite having been warned to the contrary, the dwarves eventually left the path after running low on supplies, and were soon waylaid by great spiders, which intended to eat them. Bilbo used the Ring to escape notice, and returned to free them. Balin afterwards led the company in escaping from and fighting off the spiders, though the dwarves were captured by Wood-elves, and taken to the hall of the Elvenking, Thranduil. It was here that Balin spoke for his companions, arguing for their release. Thranduil refused, and imprisoned the dwarves, until Bilbo again rescued the company.[7]
The dwarves came to Lake-town,[8] and then to the Lonely Mountain. After opening the Side-door to the mountain,[9] Balin was the only member of the company willing to go with the hobbit some way inside. The hobbit, after unintentionally disturbing the dragon Smaug, returned to the dwarves, but Smaug left his lair and attempted to kill the dwarves before turning to Lake-town, with the intent to destroy it.[10] The dragon was there slain by Bard, and the dwarves took possession of the mountain.[11] Thorin and Balin, not long after, came upon the raven Roäc, who brought word of the dragon's demise.[12]
Balin fought in and survived the subsequent Battle of Five Armies, which was fought against orcs led by Bolg, after tensions with the Lakemen and Wood-elves had run high, due to a disagreement about the division of Smaug's treasure.[13] He took up residence at the Lonely Mountain afterwards with the surviving members of the company.

 Visiting Bilbo 
Seven years after the quest for Erebor, Balin accompanied Gandalf to visit Bilbo in the Shire in TA 2949, since the two had become good friends during their travels. He and Gandalf gave Bilbo the news of current happenings in middle earth.[14]

 Expedition and death 
    Balin at his death bed  
In TA 2989, Balin led an expedition in an attempt to reclaim the ancient dwarf kingdom of Moria, hoping to reestablish Dwarven rule and to reclaim the last of the Seven Rings of the Dwarves.[15] While in Moria, he discovered Durin's Axe and a Mithril helm. Ultimately, the search for the ring, which conferred great wealth and a curse of greed on its owner, was in vain, as it had been recaptured from Thráin II by Sauron. Although he was of royal blood, the colony was too small for a kingdom—thus Balin could only call himself ""Lord of Moria"". Balin himself, as were the rest of those that followed him, was slain by Orcs, bringing to an end the attempt to retake Moria.[16] Ironically he died in the same place and the same way as his father had been slain 195 years before in TA 2799.

 Legacy 
    Balin's tomb at the time of the Fellowship's arrival  Some twenty-five years later in TA 3019, the Fellowship of the Ring passed through Moria and discovered Balin's tomb, and the truth of what happened to his expedition, which had not previously been known, in the Book of Mazarbul. The knowledge of this brought much grief to Balin's cousin Gimli, who was a member of the fellowship.[16]
 Characteristics 
Balin was a discerning character, being described as the company's ""look-out man"": He spotted Bilbo approaching The Green Dragon Inn at Bywater; he spotted the trolls' fire, and; he was the first to spot the Elves in Mirkwood. He noted that not even a mouse had ever passed him on watch, and wondered why he did not notice Bilbo (hidden by wearing the magic ring) when he was lookout for the company after escaping the Orcs in the Misty Mountains. Among the Dwarves of the company, Balin was the second-eldest dwarf, and loosely held the position of deputy leader.
Balin gained respect for Bilbo's abilities, and was the only dwarf who volunteered to accompany Bilbo down the secret passage to Smaug's chamber. Of all the Dwarves in the quest, Balin was the only one known to have visited Bilbo at Bag End after their quest for the Lonely Mountain.

 Portrayal in adaptations 
 Rankin/Bass films 
In the 1977 animated version of The Hobbit, he was voiced by Don Messick.

 The Hobbit film trilogy 
In Peter Jackson's live-action adaptation, he was portrayed by Scottish actor Ken Stott. The studio released the following statement regarding Balin in the films:

A descendant of nobility and a Dwarf Lord in his own right, Balin is one of the oldest members of The Company of Dwarves. Wise and gentle by nature, he has been forced to live a life fraught with war and the ongoing struggle for survival. Related to Thorin Oakenshield, Balin is one of his closest, most trusted advisers – but deep in his heart, this wisest and most loyal of Dwarves harbors troubling doubts about the wisdom of the Quest for the Lonely Mountain.
In The Hobbit: An Unexpected Journey, Balin shows his wisdom when he tells Fíli and Kíli and Bilbo about Thorin’s dislike for orcs.
In The Hobbit: The Desolation of Smaug, Balin persuades Bard the Bowman to take them safely to Lake-town in return for a huge amount of money (double Bard's usual barge fare), an event that did not occur in the book.
In The Hobbit: The Battle of the Five Armies, Balin fights in and survives the battle, during which he helps to man a dwarven war chariot and transport Dwalin, Fíli, and Kíli to Ravenhill. He later personally bids Bilbo farewell at his leaving.

 Personality 
Balin is portrayed to be the wiser, more social and skeptical individual in Thorin and Company. He is kind, sly and brave, an excellent fighter. Thorin, at one point, quoted on Balin's skill as a fighter. He develops an essentially strong relationship with the other Dwarves he travelled with and was willing to fight alongside them for any cause. He was sympathetic, sometimes cynical, towards Bilbo Baggins, remarking that the latter wasn't fit for the job they had set out to do. He got on brilliantly with Thorin, and seemed to share something of a grandfatherly view of the latter.

 Trivia 
 While in the Book, Balin is about twenty years younger than Thorin, in Peter Jackson's three-part adaptation, Balin is ranked as the oldest member of the company.
 In the 1977 Rankin/Bass adaptation of 'The Hobbit', Balin, voiced by Don Messick, is one of the few dwarves to have a major role in the film.
 In Peter Jackson's films, Balin fights with a weapon with similarities of a sword and a mace, which Ken Stott, asked for himself.
 Of all the dwarves on the quest to reclaim the Lonely Mountain, Balin was the only dwarf known to have visited Bilbo Baggins after the journey.

","Durin was the name of many Dwarves in the First, Second, and Third Ages, starting with Durin the Deathless, after whom the Line was named. All descendants of Durin I who greatly resembled him were given his name.

 Line of Durin 
 Durin I 
King Durin I, known also as Durin the Deathless, of Khazad-dûm (Years of the Trees? - First Age) was the oldest of the Seven Fathers of the Dwarves, first created by Aulë the Vala. Durin was set to sleep alone beneath Mount Gundabad in Middle-earth until the Elves awoke. The name Durin, like other names of Tolkien's Dwarves, was taken from Old Norse. In Tolkien's fiction, Dalish (the language of Dale) had the same relationship to Rohirric and Westron as Old Norse has to English, so since Westron was rendered in English, the language of Dale was rendered in Old Norse. The Dwarvish names were in the language of Dale, which therefore was rendered in Old Norse in The Hobbit and The Lord of the Rings.
J.R.R. Tolkien took Durin's name, as with most other dwarf names in his work, from real Norse mythology (in which Durin was the name of the first of the Seven Fathers of the Dwarves and the forger of many wonderful items).
Upon his awakening at Mount Gundabad in the Years of the Trees, he traveled until he came upon the Mirrormere, the lake that the Dwarves call Kheled-zâram. He created there a great city within the Misty Mountains. This was Khazad-dûm, known by Elves as Moria.
According to the Dwarves, Durin awoke at Mount Gundabad in the north of the Misty Mountains, which remained a sacred place to them ever after. Durin and his heirs were revered by all Dwarves, and not just those of his own line.
Durin founded the line of Dwarves called Durin's Folk. Durin was called the Deathless because he lived far longer than any other known dwarf. It was also believed that Durin would be reincarnated a total of six times, each time as a descendant of an older Durin.
Later, while passing through Moria with the Fellowship, Gimli sang a poem about Durin. 
Durin's Axe and Durin's Helm remained in Khazad-dûm after it was deserted in the TA 1981 year of the Third Age. In TA 2989 the relics were found again by Balin's expedition, and lost again in TA 2994 when the Dwarf-colony was destroyed. (See Book of Mazarbul.)

This cooperation continued until the reign of Durin IV.

Durin III (Second Age ? - Second Age ?) was the first bearer of one of the Seven Rings, although this was not known to outsiders until the end of the Third Age. The Dwarves of Durin's folk claim the ring was given by Celebrimbor himself, and not by Sauron, though Sauron was involved in the making. This was the ring that Thráin II carried and had taken from him when he was captured by the agents of Sauron.[1]

 Durin VII the Last 
    Durin VII as depicted in The Lord of the Rings Trading Card Game  
Durin VII, also known as Durin the Last, was held to be the last king of the line of Durin I.[1] His birth was prophesied by the Dwarves in the conclusion of the Battle of the Five Armies, that in the direct line of Dáin II Ironfoot there will be an heir, but the last of his line.[2], and he led Durin's Folk from Erebor to recolonise Khazad-dûm ""several centuries"" after the beginning of the Fourth Age, where they remained ""until the world grew old and the Dwarves failed and the days of Durin's race were ended"".[3]

Frór (TA 2552 – TA 2589) was a dwarf of the Grey Mountains (Ered Mithrin) and was of the line of Durin.
He had an older brother, Thrór, and a younger brother, Grór. He was the second son of Dáin I.
Frór spent his short life in the Grey Mountains. He was slain with his father when a Cold-drake invaded the doors of the mountain palace. Shortly after they were laid to rest in the tombs of the mountain halls, the kingship was passed on to Frór's older brother Thrór. Durin's Folk then resolved to abandon the Grey Mountains. It was Thrór who founded the kingdom of the Lonely Mountain and led a portion of his people there. However, the greater part of Durin's folk followed the youngest brother Grór to the Iron Hills.

Mîm, or Mîm the Dwarf[1], was a Petty-dwarf of the First Age and possibly the last of the Petty-dwarves. He was mostly a part in the adventures of Turin Turambar.

Contents[show]
 Biography 
    Mîm captured by men  
Mîm lived with his two sons at Amon Rûdh in middle Beleriand, where he kept a secret treasury. During Túrin's time with the Outlaws, Mîm and sons were seen as they snuck past the outlaws carrying heavy sacks. Mîm was captured, and arrows were shot at his sons Ibun and Khîm.
In exchange for his life, Mîm was forced to lead the outlaws to his secret halls in Amon Rûdh. There, it turned out Khîm had been killed by an arrow loosed by Androg, who was then forced to break his bow and arrows, and Túrin repenting offered his service to Mîm. For this reason Mîm tolerated the outlaws, and at the least came to respect Túrin (and was even jealous of Túrin's love for Beleg).

    Mîm leads Túrin and his Men to Amon Rûdh  
When Beleg Cúthalion arrived at Amon Rûdh, Mîm was angry: he hated Elves, especially the Sindar. Nevertheless he had to tolerate the elf in his halls. This hatred toward Beleg led Mim to betray Amon Rûdh to Morgoth. In one of the first known accounts of a wicked dwarf having an alliance with Orcs or goblins. After Amon Rûdh was betrayed to Morgoth, All the outlaws were slain, save Túrin and Beleg. Beleg was left tied up on the summit of Amon Rûdh by the Orcs, and there Mîm found him and attempted to kill him but was scared away by a dying outlaw called Andróg. Mîm escaped, but it seems Ibûn was killed by Orcs. Eventually Mîm made his way to ruined Nargothrond after Túrin had killed Glaurung, and took the treasure for his own.
Húrin Thalion, who had seen all that had happened to Túrin with Morgoth's eyes, with a band of outlaws. But the folk of Mîm were few, and the outlaws filled with the lust of the treasure slew them, though Húrin would have stayed them[2]; though he deemed him partially responsible for Túrin's fate (the nature of who killed the dwarf, the nature of the treasure, and size of Hurin's band varies in post-humus edited ""stories'). With his dying words Mîm cursed the treasure. Húrin's band brought the treasure of Nargothrond (but not before most had killed each other along the way brought down by the treasures curse), and Thingol had to send his own men to bring the treasure to Doriath, where eventually the gold was a reason for the Sack of Doriath and the death of Thingol.[3][4]

 Other versions of the legendarium 
Note that in the published The Silmarillion Mîm hardly appears. His role is much expanded in the Narn i Chîn Húrin as published in the Unfinished Tales, and in the Wanderings of Húrin.
The earliest and most revised version of Mîm's story is the story of hoard of Norgrothond, and has changed several several times. In some versions a curse is included, or hinted at, in others there is no curse. As well as differences of when the curse took place (did he curse the gold before or after he was given a mortal wound, or both before and after). Other changes include when the Necklace of the Dwarves was made; after the treasure was taken (possibly made from cursed gold), or before.
In earlier versions of the Silmarillion as detailed in The History of Middle-earth series, Mîm was a much more evil character, who actively betrayed Túrin. But as Dwarves gradually changed in Tolkien's writings from evil Orc-like beings to the Dwarves they later became, Mîm's character was changed, and in the final texts he is no longer a true villain, but almost a tragic character in his own right. However in The Children of Hurin certain details are taken in a darker direction, with Mîm actively betraying Turin's company in malice and revenge, and the intent to kill Beleg (but only having mercy for Turin (and this mainly because he also had troubles with the elves)). It it is not nearly as tragic, as some of the previously published portrayals (though it does make note that alternate tales are somewhat more sympathetic to the dwarf).
Much of Mim's framework of the original more 'evil' or 'darker' Mim in Nargothrond is restored in Beren and Lúthien (2017) including the full nature of his curse, its influence on Hurin, his allies, the corruption of more sinister/greedy dwarves, traitorous elves, treacherous dwarves from within and without Doriath leading to its downfall, the location of Thingol's death outside of the Thousand Caves, and dwarves defeat at Sarn Athrad where bulk of the cursed treasure is lost, and the later downfall of Dior in another Kinslaying. However, as neither Mim nor Hurin are a focus in the story not all the details of the encounter are discussed (nor Mim's backstory).
In the Lost Tales, Mîm is the captain of the guard for Glaurung, who protects his treasures while he is away. He guards the treasures along with other Orcs and possible fallen elves. He curses the treasures with wards of protection. Húrin comes, and Mîm warns him of the curse on the gold both from the dragon laying on it for long years, and because he too had put magical wards on it. Only Mîm could safely handle the gold because he was put in charge of it, and had also bound the gold to himself. Turin feared him at first, but was convinced by his elven guard to seize it all. Mîm then put many evil curses on the men. In response Húrin killed him as punishment for the cruel behaviour from the dwarf, when they originally had planned to just take the treasure and leave him alone. Mîm issues one final curse as he lay dieing that elves and men would rue the deed, and that death would follow the gold as long as it remained on earth (the curse would effect any portion of it even if divided). The elves laughed, but Húrin was bothered by it. They then carried the gold away. The curse did its deed leading men to kill each other, elves to kill each other, men killing elves, and Dwarves killing elves. Finally it lead to a civil war among the Dwarves that never ended, even after the gold was lost.
In the The Shaping of Middle Earth, ""Mîm the Dwarf"" is just a byline he was a random dwarf (though the first dwarf to be mentioned by name in the early histories) who had taken possession Glaurung's gold after the dragon had been killed along with other Dwarves of his kind. While there he had enchanted all the gold (a nod back to the black songs and curses he made on the gold as wards while he was the Captain of the dragon's guard). Húrin and his band of outlaws come to the hoard kill the other dwarven guards, and all slay Mîm, and take the hoard. This changes the story from one person to many taking the gold (though he left out this group in some later revisions at the time). The curse goes on to lead to the deaths of several factions before finally being lost. Only hint of Mîm's character comes from the fact that he enchanted the gold (but it doesn't specifically show him to be evil), but his race is however shown to be evil when they plot against Thingol (but this is modified in later revisions and stories the Dwarves tend to lean more to sociably neutral but not evil, with the evil ones being categorized under Petty-dwarves).
In the Lost Road, Mîm is only briefly mentioned in the Annals, similar to earlier version; Again Mîm is just a random dwarf (this time apparently alone) that had taken over Nargothrond hoard. He slew the dwarf (there is no mention of any others with him), but the dwarf had cursed the treasure, and it is brought to Thingol. Thingol employs Dwarves to craft him the Nauglamir. Enmity awakens between Dwarves and elves, and he sends them away. The Dwarves and Elves from Belegost and Nogrod return in force and invade Doriath. They were allowed in by treacherous elves who had been smitten by the curse. Thingol is slain in the caves. Dwarves are later ambushed, Beren keeps the necklace, and gold is thrown into the river. Later, kinstrife occurs although in this version it is not ascribed to the curse.
The role of traitor in Turin's band in these early writings instead given to Blodrin, a Elf that had lived among the evil Dwarves and become like them. The two ideas were later merged into Mîm's character.
Mîm is briefly mentioned in The Adventures of Tom Bombadil in regards to the poem, The Hoard. The poem itself written by Bilbo apparently; appears to be loosely inspired by the stories of the elves, the death of Mîm, the coming of Glaurung, and the coming of Turin. In this version the old dwarf (apparently Mîm the Dwarf) takes the Elven-home from the elves after they fall into shadow, and takes over their hoard. In time the dragon comes to take over his hoard from him destroying him in the process. Then comes the warrior (apparently Turin) who slays him and dies in the process. The treasure is taken by his father.
In the version published in Silmarillion (1977) the is no reference to the curse, only the Nauglamir is taken from the hoard, and all the actions that occur appear to be due to greed and paranoia of all involved. In cold blooded murder and wicked actions, Thingol was slain inside the caves, and the Dwarves working for him steal his treasures, and the necklace, and then are later slain themselves.. But it is unclear how much of this is an invention by Tolkien or Guy Gavriel Kay.
The Children of Húrin does not go far enough into the story of Húrin to reintroduce the curse into the story, though it did reintroduce direct betrayal of Turin's company by Mîm, and other darker details left out of the Silmarillion or even the account in Unfinished Tales. The version given in Beren and Lúthien reintroduces the full extent of the curse.

Telchar was a Dwarf of Nogrod in the Blue Mountains during the First Age.

Contents[show]
 Biography 
Telchar was one of the greatest smiths of the First Age of Middle-earth, having learned from Gamil Zirak the old.[1] Telchar was commonly regarded amongst the greatest smiths of all time, save only Fëanor and Celebrimbor. Among his works were the knife Angrist, the sword Narsil (later reforged as Andúril), and the Dragon-helm of Dor-lómin, worn eventually by Túrin Turambar.
Neither Telchar's lifespan nor details of his personal life are known, but it is known that the Dragon Helm of Dor-lómin was made shortly after the dragon Glaurung first appeared, in the 265th year of the First Age.[2]

 Earlier versions 
In earlier versions of the legendarium, such as the second version of The Lay of the Children of Húrin (in The Lays of Beleriand) and those in the The Shaping of Middle-earth, Telchar was originally one of the Wicked dwarves of Belegost. In this version Telchar made the Dragon-helm in the dark dwarf-land in the deeps of time.

 Biography 
Lalia was born in TA 2883 (SR 1283). She married in TA 2914, and her son Ferumbras was born two years later. Ferumbras never married, reportedly because nobody wanted Lalia as a mother-in-law. Lalia was so fat she couldn't walk and was confined to a wheelchair: she was widely known as Lalia the Great (or sometimes the Fat). In TA 3002, her attendant, Pearl Took, accidentally tipped Lalia out of her wheelchair into her garden, and she died in TA 3002 (SR 1402). (Lalia is not on the Took family tree published in The Lord of the Rings, but she is mentioned in The Letters of J.R.R. Tolkien.)[1]

","    Christopher Tolkien in the 2010s  Christopher Reuel Tolkien (November 21, 1924 - January 16, 2020) was best known as the son of author J.R.R. Tolkien, and as the editor of much of his father's posthumously published work. He drew the original maps for his father's The Lord of the Rings (which he signed C. J. R. T.  - the J. for John, a baptismal name he does not ordinarily use).
On August 31st, 2017, he resigned as long-time owner and a director of the Tolkien Estate Limited[1][2], but remained his father's literary executor.

Contents[show]
 Biography 
Chistopher Tolkien was born in Leeds, England, the third son of J.R.R. Tolkien. He was educated at the Dragon School in Oxford and then at the Oratory School. During World War II, he served as a pilot in the Royal Air Force, after which he read English at Oxford University.
Young Christopher had long been part of the critical audience for his father's fiction, first as a child listening to tales of Bilbo Baggins, and then as a teenager and young adult offering much feedback on The Lord of the Rings during its fifteen-year gestation. Christopher himself had the task of interpreting his father's sometimes self-contradictory maps of Middle-earth in order to produce the versions used in the books. Christopher re-drew the main map in the late 1970's to clarify the lettering and correct some errors and omissions. He appointed Stephen Raw to assist in the map presentation for one of the releases of the trilogy.
He followed in his father's footsteps in academia, becoming a lecturer and tutor in English language at New College, Oxford in 1964, until 1975.
His father had written a great deal of material on Middle-earth mythos that was not published in his lifetime; although he had originally intended to publish The Silmarillion along with The Lord of the Rings, and parts of it were in a finished state - he died in 1973 with the project unfinished. And so, Christopher then embarked on organizing the masses of his father's notes, some of them written on odd scraps of paper a half-century earlier. Much of the material was handwritten, frequently a fair draft was written over a half-erased first draft, and names of characters routinely changed between the beginning and end of the same draft. Deciphering this was an arduous task, and perhaps only someone with personal experience of J.R.R. and the evolution of his stories could have made any sense of it; even so, Christopher has admitted to having to occasionally guess at what his father intended.

Nandor (Laiquendi)



Denethor was the son of the Nandor Elf leader Lenwë, who lived during the Years of the Trees.

 Biography 
Hearing of the power of Thingol, Denethor led many of his people over the Blue Mountains to Beleriand. They settled in Ossiriand, renaming it Lindon, in the east of Beleriand, and Denethor became their king.[2][3] They were called the Laiquendi, or Green-elves. Some time later after his return from Aman, Morgoth loosed an army on Beleriand beginning the First Battle. The lightly-armed Laiquendi were driven back to the great hill of Amon Ereb, where Denethor was slain. The Laiquendi became a reclusive people, seldom taking up arms, and never again naming a king.[4]

 Etymology 
The name Denethor comes from the Nandorin words dene (""strong, lithe"") and thara (""tall, slender""), and gives the name a meaning of ""Lithe and lank"".[5]

Elu Thingol was an Elf of the Teleri during the First Age. His brother was Olwë, who became the Lord of Alqualondë, Lord of Tol Eressëa, and High King of the Teleri of Aman, both of whom may have had a second brother called Elmo. He was a good friend of Finwë, the first High King of the Ñoldor during the times before the elves reached Aman.
He was the founder and first King of the northern Elven Kingdom of Doriath and was respected by all the Sindar of the Beleriand, who considered him to be the High King of the Sindar and the Lord of Beleriand.

 Biography 
 Sundering of the Elves 
    Finwë and Elwë in Cuiviénen before the Great Journey to Aman, by  Kazuki-Mendou  
Elwë was born in Cuiviénen during the Years of the Trees to unnamed parents. He first appears in the history of the Eldar when he travels from Cuiviénen with Oromë as ambassador of the Teleri to see the land of Valinor. Interestingly, since Thingol had previously visited Valinor as an ambassador of the Teleri, he is debateably both of the Sindar and of the Calaquendi. Upon his return, he manages to convince many of his people to follow him back to that country. On the Great Journey to the West, the Teleri lag behind, and do not arrive at the coast until after the departure of the moving island of Tol Eressëa. Thus, they stay in Beleriand for many years until Tol Eressëa is brought again to fetch them. By this time, many of the Teleri have grown to like Beleriand, and decide to stay there. Elwë is among them, having encountered Melian the Maia in the woods of Nan Elmoth and fallen deeply in love with her. Afterwards, he disappeared for many years causing many of his people to linger in Middle-earth or stay there until he could be found.[3]

    Elwë is enchanted by Melian in the woods of Nan Elmoth, by WilderWein77 now IreneLangholm  
 Rule of Doriath 
For centuries Elwë remained lost until he reemerged as a respected lord and many of his people joined him in the great forested area of the Beleriand. Now known as Thingol, he and Melian become king and queen of the Teleri who stay in Beleriand, who then become known as the Sindar. He founded a realm in a large forested area in the Beleriand first known as Eglador (Land of the Forsaken). During these early days under the stars, Thingol and Melian have a daughter named Lúthien, who is said to be the fairest woman ever to have lived.
As Lord of Beleriand, he welcomed his long lost kin now known as the Laiquendi or Green-elves vast lands in Ossiriand which they would name Lindon. He was also the first elf to make contact and alliances with the Dwarves of Belegost who helped delve the caves of the great Fortress/City of Menegroth which became the capital of Thingol's kingdom. When the Dwarves first became aware of unknown but savage creatures coming from out of the North, Thingol was the first to know about it and not having any heavy weapons of war he once again asked the Dwarves for their aid. They forged for him weapons and armour he needed to fight them.[4]

 The Quest for the Silmaril 
When Melkor returned to Middle-earth, he sought once again to master Middle-earth and its peoples and declared war on them. He sent his great hosts of Orcs into the Beleriand starting what became known as the First Battle of Beleriand. Thingol led his people to victory against the Orcs successfully driving them out of his kingdom and most of the Beleriand. Afterwards, Melian set the Girdle around his kingdom which would be known from then on as Doriath which no one could enter without his permission. When the Ñoldor returned to Middle-earth, he gave them leave to dwell in the north part and dealt only with the House of Finarfin as they were kin through his brother Olwë. When he learned of the Kinslaying at Alqualondë, he was outraged and wanted nothing to do with most of the Ñoldor and their war and even outlawed the use of Quenya in his kingdom.[5]
Thingol was drawn into the war with Morgoth and the deadly Oath of Fëanor when after the Dagor Bragollach, Lúthien fell in love with a man named Beren. Thingol did not wish for the two to be wedded to each other, as he valued his daughter very highly and disliked the race of Men. As a bride-price he asked for a Silmaril from the crown of Morgoth, thinking there was no way that Beren could fulfill this demand. Thus, Thingol was drawn into the quarrels over the great jewels and ultimately the doom of Fëanor.[6]

 Death 
It was, however, this very bride-price that doomed him. After Húrin brought the treasures of Nargothrond to Doriath, Thingol summoned Dwarves of Belegost to Menegroth and invited them to work the treasure into jewelry. The finest of these pieces was the Nauglamír.
The Nauglamír was the second-greatest treasure of Doriath, prized above all but Beren and Lúthien's Silmaril. After the smiths of Belegost finished their work on the Nauglamír, Thingol requested that the Dwarves of Nogrod set the Silmaril in it. The Nauglamír, now bearing the Silmaril was held to be the fairest object in Arda.
Enthralled by its beauty and greedy for the Silmaril, the Dwarves demanded the necklace insisting that as dwarf work it belonged to them. Thingol was unwilling to surrender the treasure and replies with an impertinent answer. In their anger, the Dwarves attempted to slay him. After a long battle between Dwarves and elves inside the city, Dwarves were driven out of the city, two escaped to Nogrod and persuaded the city to march on Doriath. They escaped and told a much different story to their home cities and got them to march on and sack Doriath. Later with the help of certain treacherous elves also possessed of the cursed treasure they regained entrance past the Girdle. Thingol was lured out on a hunt with but a small company of arms, where he was ambushed by waiting Dwarves, and was slain. The fortress of the Thousand Caves was taken at unawares and plundered. They could not seize nor harm Melian, and she left to seek Beren and Lúthien.[7]
Thingol's heir was Dior Eluchil, the son of Beren and Lúthien.[8]

 Etymology 
Elu Thingol derives from the Sindarin Elu Sindacollo, meaning ""Elu Greycloak"", from thind or sinda (""grey"") and collo (""cloak"").[9]
The original form of his name was Elwë Singollo from the Quenya el (""star"") and wë (""person"").[10]

 Weapons 
Thingol's sword was called Aranrúth (""King's Ire"") which later became the sword of the Númenórean kings.[11] He also owned Anglachel, the sword forged by Eöl who gave it to him as payment for dwelling in Nan Elmoth.[12]

Gandalf: ""Your grandfather Thror was killed, you remember, in the Mines of Moria by Azog the Goblin.""Thorin: ""Curse his name, yes.""
—The Hobbit, ""An Unexpected Party""

Azog was an orc of the Third Age who commanded the tribes of Moria from TA 2790 until his death in TA 2799. He was responsible for the death of King Thrór and for King Thráin's madness.[2]

Contents[show]
 Biography 
Azog was a powerful orc chieftain who claimed rulership over the abandoned Dwarvish mines of Moria during the Third Age. He became the leader of the Goblins of Moria and initiated the War of the Dwarves and Orcs in TA 2790 by beheading King Thrór, who had come to revisit the ruins of the ancient dwarven kingdom of Moria. At some point he had a son named Bolg. In the following years, Azog was the common enemy of all dwarves, and the war he started had its climax in the Battle of Azanulbizar, where he killed Náin, only to be himself slain by Náin's son Dáin, who would later become King of Durin's Folk. His son, Bolg, inherited the reign in Moria and continued it for decades until his death at the Battle of Five Armies.

    Azog after killing Náin  
Azog entered history in the year TA 2790 due to King Thrór's desire to revisit and perhaps restore the lost realm of Khazad-dûm. Azog beheaded Thrór, and carved his name in Thrór's head, then threw the body over the stairs. Azog then demanded that the Dwarf Nár deliver a message back to Thrór's people, warning that beggars who dared to enter Moria and attempted thievery would meet a similar fate.[3]
Azog then called out that he had killed Thrór, and that he now ruled Moria as king. His name in runes was carved onto the brow of Thrór, forever branding it into the hearts of the Dwarves. Nár was barred from retrieving the head of Thrór, and the orcs threw him a small pouch of coins of little worth as a final gesture of scorn. Nár took the pouch, turned, and fled. When he looked back, orcs had emerged from the gate and were hacking apart Thrór's body and flinging the pieces as carrion for the crows.[3]
When news of this reached Thrór's heir Thráin, he was greatly angered and mustered a force of Dwarves from the House of Durin and others to seek revenge on Azog, though this preparation took three years. So began the War of the Dwarves and Orcs: the Dwarves began to hunt Azog, and many battles were fought beneath the earth. After nine years of war, before the gates of Moria itself, the climactic Battle of Azanulbizar was fought and Azog emerged from the gate of Moria. In that battle, Azog slew Náin on the stairs, but was beheaded by Dáin, son of Náin when he attempted to retreat. His head was impaled on a stake, and the pouch of coins he had thrown to Nár was stuffed into his mouth.[3]
Except for Thráin, the Dwarves made no attempt to press their advantage by pursuing the orcs into the mines, many of them having been slain. They warned Thráin against entering Moria. Dáin had glimpsed Durin's Bane deep within and warned the Dwarves to not attempt entering Moria.[3] Azog's underground realm's population had been greatly reduced in the war and his reign passed to his son Bolg for the next 150 years, until Bolg's death in the Battle of Five Armies.

 Other mentions 
Azog is mentioned briefly in The Hobbit by Gandalf, who says to Thorin, ""Your grandfather Thrór was killed, you remember, in the mines of Moria by Azog the Goblin,"" to which Thorin responds ""Curse his name, yes"". Incidentally, this is the only place that J.R.R. Tolkien refers to Azog as a ""goblin""; in other books such as The Lord of the Rings, Tolkien describes him as a ""great Orc.""[4] This is not a discrepancy, however, since in Tolkien's writings, goblin is merely a synonym of Orc.

 Portrayal in adaptations 
 The Hobbit film trilogy 
""Moria had been taken by legions of Orcs led by the most vile of their race... Azog the Defiler. The giant Gundabad orc had sworn to wipe out the line of Durin. He began... by beheading the king.""
—Balin, in The Hobbit: An Unexcpected Journey    Azog holding up Thror's decapitated head  ","The name Boldog was used by several Orc chieftains in the First Age.
It is probable that Boldog was actually a title, given to lesser Maiar serving Morgoth Bauglir who had taken an Orcish hröa.[1]

Bolg was an Orc leader of the Misty Mountains in the late Third Age, and the son of Azog.
Contents[show]
 Biography 
In The Hobbit, Bolg had succeeded Azog after the latter's death in the Battle of Azanulbizar (the last battle of the War of the Dwarves and Orcs) in TA 2799 by Dáin II Ironfoot, and had resettled in the old refuge of Mount Gundabad after the kingdom of Angmar was abandoned. There he would rule over the goblins of the Misty Mountains from their seat at Mount Gundabad.
After about 150 years, he led an army of goblins, wargs, and bats in the Battle of the Five Armies, into which he took his bodyguards with him as well. In that battle he was crushed by the mighty Beorn, who in the act avenged Thorin II Oakenshield, who had just been fatally wounded.[1]

 Etymology 
The meaning of the name Bolg is uncertain. As discussed in the book The History of The Hobbit [2], the word bolg is listed as meaning ""strong"" in the vocabulary list for Mágol, one of the languages constructed by Tolkien. Mágol seems to have been based on Hungarian, and Tolkien seems to have worked on it in the years he was writing The Hobbit, or even earlier. The History of The Hobbit also cites Bolg as being a word of unknown meaning in the language of the Iverni, a people of early Ireland mentioned in Ptolemy's 2nd century Geography. This would be supported by Celtic legends about the Fir Bolg; one of the enemies of the Tuatha de Danan.

 Portrayals in adaptations 
 The Hobbit film trilogy 
In Peter Jackson's The Hobbit film trilogy, Bolg was played by Lawrence Makoare in The Hobbit: The Desolation of Smaug and John Tui in The Hobbit: The Battle of the Five Armies. He is portrayed as a huge, pale Orc clad in armor and bones. Bolg's father Azog has a greatly expanded role in The Hobbit: An Unexpected Journey, the first film of the trilogy.

    Bolg and his father Azog consulting with each other in Dol Guldur.  
Bolg appears extensively in The Hobbit: The Desolation of Smaug. he bears a strong resemblance to his father, Azog the Defiler (who survives the War of the Dwarves and Orcs in the films). Azog is summoned to Dol Guldur to become the commander of Sauron's orc armies. While there, Azog dispatches his son Bolg to take his place in hunting Thorin and his company. With his pack of Orcs, Bolg tracks Thorin and Company through Mirkwood, where he and his pack of Orcs attack the Wood-elves as the Dwarves escape in barrels. Bolg and his pack continued to track down the Dwarves, which eventually lead them to Lake-town.
Around nightfall, Bolg and his Orcs arrive at Lake-town where they attack Bard's family in search of the Dwarves, but they only found four. When they attack, they are in turn attacked by Legolas and Tauriel who were tracking the Orcs down. He goes after Legolas, and the two begin a duel (in which Legolas uses Orcrist, the weapon that Thorin held during his quest to Erebor). While Legolas is distracted by other Orcs, Bolg withdraws from the duel and rides away on his Warg down a dock. He is then pursued by Legolas, who was now on a horse and chased after him.
Bolg later reports to his father that he was attacked by Legolas and Azog yells at him because the Elf Prince survived and would now send an army after the Orcs. He then tells Bolg to travel to Mount Gundabad and prepare a second Orc army for war along with swarms of Bats. Legolas and Tauriel follow Bolg to Gundabad and leave to warn the others. Bolg later appears at Ravenhill with his second army to aid Azog. Bolg knocks Bilbo out with his mace before finding Tauriel and badly injuring her in combat. Before he can finish her, Kili arrives and briefly duels the Orc but Bolg proves to be stronger and he impales Kili through the chest with his mace's hilt resulting in the Dwarf's death. In anger, Tauriel throws Bolg off the mountain and is dragged down with him. He is then spotted by Legolas and the two engage in a fierce duel ending with Legolas killing Bolg by stabbing a dagger through his head. The giant Gundabad orc then falls down to a large rock below, and was crushed by a giant boulder.

 Personality 
    Bolg summoned by his father in Dol Guldur  
Hardly any different from Azog, Bolg is a murderous, callous, idealistic, merciless and cruel warrior. He is extremely sadistic, showing no qualms about massacring the Men of the Lake-town and even relishing Kili's death. He is also psychopathic and remorseless, shown by how he pitilessly orders the attack on Laketown. But he is highly intelligent, an excellent leader and tactician. Bolg is enigmatic and powerful, possessing immense strength of will and superb tactical ability. He shows himself to be just as pitiless as his warrior father and is almost unimaginably determined and ferocious. Despite this, he has a strong relationship with Azog as Bolg displays fierce loyalty to his father and a great desire to make him proud.

 Abilities 
Bolg is a skillful leader, which is likely why he was Azog's second-in-command of the Gundabad Orc pack. He is highly skillful in hand-to-hand combat and swordsmanship. His fighting style, (unlike Azog's preferred Warg-riding style that emphasized blows with heavy momentum) is emphasized with lightning speed and agility, as well as martial arts techniques and using the environment against his opponent. His skill as a fighter is later shown by how he is put in charge of the Orc packs whilst Azog stays to fight Gandalf. Bolg has an astonishingly high tolerance of pain, shown by the fact that he refuses to show pain or even bleed when Legolas plunges his knife into his hand nearing the end of their battle. Though his preferred fighting style is surely not Warg-riding, he is highly skilled at it.

 Models and toys 
    Miniature by Games Workshop (N.B. This miniature was initially released under the name ""Bolg,"" but after Bolg's appearance was re-vamped for The Hobbit: The Desolation of Smaug, the miniature's name was changed to ""Gundabad Orc General"").  
A model of Bolg was done as a miniature by the Games Workshop, though the title became obsolete following the decision to change the identity of the character and create a new appearance for Bolg in The Desolation of Smaug.

Bolg appears as the final boss in The Hobbit GBA game.

Gorgol was an Orc chieftain, also called The Butcher, who lived in Beleriand during the First Age.

 Biography 
Gorgol was called ""Butcher"" because of the many foes he ""butchered"". He was the leader of the team which slaughtered Barahir and his companions near Tarn Aeluin. He claimed the famous Ring of Barahir, and later was slain by Beren who took back his father's ring.
Gorgol, holding the hand of Barahir aloft, said that he was minded to keep the Ring and declare to Morgoth that the hand of Barahir was bare. But at that moment Beren sprang into the camp, slew Gorgol, and seized the hand, making his escape.[citation needed]","

Halbarad was a Dúnadan Ranger of the North, and one of Aragorn's comrades during the weeks leading up to Sauron's final demise.

Contents[show]
 Biography 
Halbarad was among the Rangers who guarded the Shire in the years prior to the War of the Ring. He said of the Hobbits, ""A little people, but of great worth are the Shire-folk. Little do they know of our long labor for the safekeeping of their borders, and yet I grudge it not.""
In response to a message sent to Rivendell by Galadriel, Halbarad led the Grey Company comprised of 30 Dúnadan south to the aid of their kinsman Aragorn. Aragorn rejoiced at their coming, and Théoden remarked thus; ""It is well! If these kinsmen be in any way like yourself, my Lord Aragorn, thirty such knights will be a strength that cannot be counted by heads.""
With them also rode Elladan and Elrohir, the sons of Elrond. They caught up with Aragorn near the Fords of Isen in Rohan in the early hours of March 6, 3019. Halbarad brought Aragorn a message from Arwen as well as a standard made by her, which Aragorn asked Halbarad to keep for him for a while.
Halbarad accompanied Aragorn to a chamber high in the Hornburg where Aragorn looked into the Palantir and revealed himself to Sauron. That morning Aragorn decided to take the Paths of the Dead, down the Dimholt Road, under the White Mountains and Halbarad and the Grey Company went with him, along with Legolas and Gimli. When they reached the entrance at daybreak on March 8, Halbarad said, ""This is an evil door, and my death lies beyond it. I will dare to pass it nonetheless...""[1]
At midnight at the Stone of Erech, Aragorn summoned the Dead to fulfill their oaths and Halbarad unfurled Aragorn's standard, which appeared black with no device in the darkness. The Grey Company and the Army of the Dead passed through the lands of the South to Pelargir, where they captured the fleet of the Corsairs. Aragorn dismissed the Dead, and the Grey Company sailed up the Anduin.[2]
When they arrived at the Pelennor Fields on March 15 in the midst of the battle, Aragorn's standard was once again unfurled but now it was seen to bear the emblem of the White Tree of Gondor and the Seven Stars and Crown of Elendil. Halbarad carried the standard onto the battlefield, where he was killed.[3]

 Etymology 
Halbarad is mostly Sindarin in origin: hal (tall) + barad (tower) = ""tall tower"".

 Portrayal in adaptations 
    Halbarad as the leader of Grey Company in The Lord of the Rings Online  
 Radio 
In The Lord of the Rings (1981 radio series), Halbarad was voiced by the actor Martyn Read.

Halbarad appears in the fan-made film Born of Hope (2009) and was played by Ollie Goodchild (as a teenager) and Lars Mattes (as a boy). An inconsistency of Halbarad's appearance is that he ended up being a teenager while Aragorn was a toddler (namely, older than Aragorn himself). If this were true, Halbarad would have been well over 90 years old when he fell in the Battle of the Pelennor Fields, and there is no indication that he belongs to the House of Elros. (He was a descendant, like all Dunedain, of the Numenoreans and the gift of long life was given to Numenor, not to Elros solely, and so Halbarad could have been older than Aragorn and still in his middle years.)

 The Lord of the Rings: War in the North 
Halbarad appears in the recent video game Lord of the Rings: War in the North as the leader of the Dúnedain guarding the Shire camped at Sarn Ford. He sends the player's party on a quest to the Barrow Downs to locate two lost rangers, Luin and Kilaren. He is modeled with greying hair and a large beard in this adaptation.

 The Lord of the Rings Online 
In The Lord of the Rings Online, Halbarad first appears as commander of Esteldin, a hidden Dúnedain city in the North Downs. He later becomes the leader of the Grey Company and leads them from Rivendell, through Eregion, Enedwaith and Dunland south, to aid Aragorn in Rohan.

Fram was the son of Frumgar and the fourth Lord of the Éothéod.

 Biography 
Fram and his people lived in the far northern part of the Wilderland just below the Grey Mountains in mid-Third Age. He was most famous for slaying the evil worm Scatha in TA 2000. Afterwards he claimed the Dragon's treasure horde which the Dwarves believed rightfully belonged to them. Knowing this, he sent back to them a necklace made from the teeth of Scatha along with a message that the Dwarves found insulting. His fate is unspecified.
He may have founded the Éothéod capital of Framsburg.[1][2]

Helm Hammerhand was the ninth King of Rohan, and the end of the first line of its Kings. His rule was plagued by war with the Dunlendings that attempted to usurp his rule of Rohan.

Contents[show]
 Biography 
Helm was born in TA 2691 and was the son of Gram. He became King at the age of fifty when his father Gram died in TA 2741 during a time of crisis. His father had fought open warfare with the Dunlendings, who operated from the captured fortress of Isengard.
During his reign, King Helm came into conflict with an arrogant and powerful landowner named Freca. Freca was a Dunlending with Rohirric blood; he claimed to be a descendant of King Fréawine of Rohan. Freca held lands - both banks of the river Adorn and his stronghold was near its source on the borders of Rohan. Freca viewed King Helm with both contempt and scorn, while Helm mistrusted Freca and was wary of him.
In TA 2754, Freca attempted to intimidate and coerce King Helm into giving his approval and consent to an arranged marriage between Freca's son Wulf I and Helm's daughter. Freca marched to a meeting of the King's council in Edoras with a great force of men, planning to threaten the King into complying with his demands. In the resulting quarrel, Helm Hammerhand smote Freca with single blow from his fist. The blow was so great Freca died soon after. Enraged, the men of Freca left Edoras, and King Helm declared Wulf and his kin enemies of the King.
Four years later in TA 2758, a combined force of Dunlendings under the leadership of Wulf, and the Corsairs of Umbar overran Rohan. Helm was defeated in battle at the Crossings of Isen, and Helm withdrew into the Hornburg at Helm's Deep (which was later renamed in his honor). There, he endured a long siege.
While King Helm and his younger son Prince Háma were besieged in the Hornburg, a force of Dunlendings under the leadership of Wulf also besieged Edoras. Prince Haleth, King Helm's elder son who was the last defender to fall, led the defence of Edoras. He fell defending the doors of the Golden Hall .
Shortly after Yule 2758, Prince Háma accompanied by a small force went out to search for food, but he and his men were lost in a blizzard and never seen again. The Hornburg held a large war-horn, and whenever it was blown, Helm would break through the Dunlending ranks, slaying many of their men. Helm's came to fear him greatly during this time and it was believed that he became so fierce and terrible, that he slew many of them with his bare hands. It was also believed that when he grew hungry and had no food he ate men.
It was said that grief and hunger made Helm more ferocious. After one such sortie, Helm died and did not return; his body was discovered the next morning frozen in the snow still standing, his eyes open, ready to fight. This led to a belief among the Rohirrim and Dunlendings that even in death the wraith of Helm Hammerhand still wandered through Rohan, and defended the Hornburg. Helm died in TA 2759 at the age of sixty-eight. Prince Haleth and Prince Háma also died during the war; his nephew Fréaláf Hildeson, who defeated the Dunlendings, succeeded Helm.
Helm was called Hammerhand because of his great strength and prowess with his fists: he was known to fight barehanded. This is sometimes attributed to a superstition that if ""he used no weapon no weapon would upon bite him"".[1][2]

 Portrayal in adaptations 
    Helm and his daughter as seen in Middle-earth: Shadow of War  
In the video game Middle-earth: Shadow of War, Helm is shown to have become a Nazgûl. He received his ring from Sauron and Celebrimbor after he was mortally wounded in an ambush during which his daughter was kidnapped. After recovering, he led a group of men to the man responsible for the ambush, but accidentally fatally struck his daughter in rage. This further fueled his anger, and he proceeded to slaughter everyone in the room, including his own troops who tried to calm him down. He wields a great hammer unlike the Helm of the books, and the story appears to have been pushed up to the end of the Second Age in order to fit in with the game's timeline. His hammer later ends up in the hands of Talion after the latter joins the nine himself.

Goldwine was the sixth King of Rohan.

Contents[show]
 Biography 
Born in TA 2619, Goldwine was the son of Fréawine. He was born during the reign of his great-grandfather, Aldor the Old. Goldwine was aged twenty-six, and already a father, when Aldor finally died in TA 2645. The crown passed to his grandfather Fréa. Fourteen years later, in TA 2659, his father Fréawine became King of Rohan when he was forty. Goldwine ascended the throne of Rohan in TA 2680 at the age of sixty-one. By the time Goldwine came to the throne he was already a grandfather.
Goldwine ruled during the ""Golden Age"" of Rohan and was very wealthy. During his rule, the guard of Rohan's borders lessened, and the Dunlendings which Aldor had driven out began to slowly return to northern Rohan. Goldwine died in TA 2699 at the age of eighty, after a rule of nineteen years. He was succeeded by his son Déor.[1]

 Etymology 
The name Goldwine means ""Gold-friend"", from the Old English ""gold"" and wine (""friend"").[2]

Déor (r. TA 2699 - TA 2718) was the seventh King of Rohan.

 Biography 
Born in TA 2644, Déor was the son of Goldwine. Déor was born
during the reign of his great-great-grandfather Aldor the Old. Déor's birth in TA 2644, created a unique situation within the House of Eorl; with his birth, five successive generations were living simultaneously in one royal house:

Aldor, (b. TA 2544 - d. TA 2645)
Fréa, (b. TA 2570 - d. TA 2659)
Fréawine, (b. TA 2594 - d. TA 2680)
Goldwine, (b. TA 2619 - d. TA 2699)
 Déor, (b. TA 2644 - d. TA 2718)

In TA 2699, King Goldwine died at the age of eighty, after a reign of nineteen years, and his son Déor, aged fifty-five, became King of Rohan.
During Déor's reign, the Dunlendings began to cause trouble again; they had slowly returned to Rohan under Goldwine's reign, after Aldor had driven them out long before. Déor rode north to fight them, but he learned that the Gondorian fortress of Isengard had fallen under Dunlendish rule. Isengard was impregnable, so Déor had to accept for the time being a northern threat to his realm.
Déor died in TA 2718 at the age of seventy-four, after a troublesome rule of nineteen years, and was succeeded by his son Gram.[1]

Brytta, also known as Léofa, was the eleventh King of Rohan.

Contents[show]
 Biography 
Born in TA 2752, Brytta was the son of Fréaláf Hildeson. He became king at the age of forty-six when his father died in TA 2798.
During his reign, Rohan was still recovering from its war with the Dunlendings, and hostilities remained at the western borders. Brytta possessed a generous nature and was always willing to help those in need, because of his generous and kind spirit he earned the epithet Léofa, which means Beloved, in the Rohirric tongue. Aside from the troubles with the Dunlendings his rule saw a new trouble, as the War of the Dwarves and Orcs caused great numbers of orcs to flee from the Misty Mountains, the Orcs sought to make strongholds and refuges in the White Mountains south of Rohan.
The Orcs made war on the people of Rohan, and Brytta fought off their incursions into Rohan and the White Mountains. The campaigns of Brytta against the Orcs were so successful that when he died it was believed that Rohan was free of Orcs.
He ruled for forty-four years until his death in TA 2842 at the age of ninety, and was succeeded by his son Walda.[1]

Walda was the twelfth King of Rohan.

Contents[show]
 Biography 
Walda was born in TA 2780 and was the son of Brytta Léofa. As Prince of Rohan, he served in the army and helped to defend the realm from the Orcs that tried to invade Rohan during King Brytta's reign. After his father's death in TA 2842, Walda succeeded on the throne at the age of his sixty-two.[1]
Some Orcs remained in Rohan, however; and nine years later after his succession in TA 2851, Walda was killed during an Orc attack in Dunharrow. His son Folca then became King and avenged his death.[1]
With a reign of only nine years, King Walda has the shortest reign of all the recorded Kings of Rohan.

 Other versions of the legendarium 
In Tolkien's earlier works, the eleventh King of Rohan, Walda's father, was initially named Brego, then Hama.[2]

Folca, also known as the Hunter, was the thirteenth King of Rohan.

 Biography 
Born in TA 2804, Folca was the son of Walda. He became King of Rohan in TA 2851 at the age of forty-seven, after his father was killed by an orc.
When his father was slain, Folca swore an oath to hunt no animal while an orc was left within the borders of Rohan. It took Folca thirteen years to hunt down and destroy all the remaining orcs, avenging the murder of his father and clearing the lands of Rohan of the threat posed by the Orcs.
In TA 2864, at the age of sixty, having fulfilled his oath to hunt down and destroy all the remaining orcs in Rohan, King Folca went to Firien Wood to hunt the great Boar of Everholt. Although King Folca managed to wound the beast during the hunt, the boar fatally gored King Folca, who died shortly after killing the boar from the tusk wounds he received. King Folca was succeeded by his son Folcwine.[1]

Folcwine was the fourteenth King of Rohan.

Contents[show]
 Biography 
Born in TA 2830, Folcwine was the son of King Folca. He succeeded the throne upon his father's death in TA 2864, at the age of thirty-four. His main agenda as King of Rohan was to re-conquer the West-March.
King Folcwine was the father of four children:

Folcred (TA 2858 - TA 2885)
Fastred (TA 2858 - TA 2885)
An unnamed daughter
Fengel (TA 2870 - TA 2953)

When news reached the ears of King Folcwine in TA 2885 that the Haradrim who had occupied South Gondor, invaded South Ithilien with a large force, King Folcwine mindful of the assistance that Gondor provided Rohan when it was besieged rapidly fulfilled the terms of the Oath of Eorl, and sent a large force of Rohirrim to the aid of Túrin II the Ruling Steward. King Folcwine desired to lead his men personally but was counselled not to do so, instead command of the forces of Rohan were entrusted to his elder twin sons Prince Folcred and Prince Fastred and although, the allied forces of Rohan and Gondor were victorious, the price paid by Rohan was quite high because both Folcred and Fastred were slain. After the victory Túrin II of Gondor paid King Folcwine a great Weregild of gold as a recompense for his losses. King Folcwine died in TA 2903 at the age of seventy-three after having reigned thirty-nine years. Folcwine was succeeded by his fourth child and youngest son Fengel.[1]

 Other versions of the legendarium 
His death date was initially TA 2885, until it was adjusted to TA 2903.[2]

Fengel was the fifteenth King of Rohan.

Contents[show]
 Biography 
Born in TA 2870, Fengel was the youngest child and only surviving son of Folcwine. In TA 2885, when Fengel was fifteen, his elder brothers Folcred and Fastred were killed during the Battle of the Crossings of Poros. With the deaths of his older brothers, Fengel automatically became heir to the Kingship of Rohan and Lordship of the Riddermark.
Eighteen years later in TA 2903, King Folcwine died having reigned for thirty-nine years, and Fengel succeeded him becoming the fifteenth King of Rohan at the age of thirty-three. Fengel's rule was both long and troubled, the successes and failures of Fengel's rule were overshadowed by the defects in his character and temperament.
Fengel's rule was characterized by recurring conflicts with his family and military commanders that stemmed from his gluttonous and avaricious nature. His son Thengel left Rohan because of disagreements with his father, and lived with his wife's family in Gondor instead of remaining in Rohan.
After a rule of fifty years, Fengel died in TA 2953 at the age of eighty-three, and Thengel reluctantly returned to Rohan.[1]

 Etymology 
The name Fengel means ""king, prince"" in Old English.[2]

Thengel was the sixteenth King of Rohan. 

Contents[show]
 Biography 
Thengel was the only son of Fengel, the fifteenth King of Rohan. He left the realm in his youth and went to live with his mother's family in Gondor. Eventually he met and married Morwen Steelsheen of Lossarnach, and he lived with her there for a while. After Fengel died in TA 2953, Thengel was called upon to return to Rohan, which he reluctantly did and succeeded his father as King of Rohan.
Morwen bore him five children in total (four daughters and a son). His only son (his second child) was called Théoden. One of his daughters was named Théodwyn, who would be the mother of Éomer and Éowyn. Thengel had learned Sindarin while living in Gondor, and in his house it was the daily tongue, together with Westron the common speech. Rohirric was not oft spoken by him, and Westron remained a common tongue at the court of his son and heir Théoden.
While king of Rohan, Thengel was served by Aragorn, who fought in disguise under the alias Thorongil.[1]

 Etymology 
In Old English, Thengel means ""king"" or ""prince"". It is similar to fengel and pengel.[2]

 Trivia 
Rohirric was not spoken by him or his heirs.[3]

""Let me lie here – to keep the ford until Éomer comes.""
—Théodred's last words[2]

Théodred was a Prince of Rohan, and the only son and heir of King Théoden, who died during the time Théoden was under Saruman's spell.

Contents[show]
 Biography 
Théodred's mother Elfhild died giving birth to him.[3] During the War of the Ring, Prince Théodred was the Second Marshal of Rohan and commanded western Rohan. He set Grimbold in command with fifty dismounted Riders, while Théodred himself manned the eyot, to cover Grimbold if he was driven back. Amidst the battle, Elfhelm found Grimbold fighting two axemen for Théodred's body.[2] Théodred was slain by an Orc-man in the First Battle of the Fords of Isen, and his body was defended by the marshal Grimbold.[4] The death of Théodred made his cousin Éomer the heir to the throne of Rohan. Little else is known about him, except that he loved Éomer like a brother, and loved no one more except for Théoden.

 Etymology 
The name Théodred is taken from the Anglo-Saxon words þeod (""folk,"" ""people,"" ""nation"") and ræd (""counsel"").[5]

 Other versions of the legendarium 
In earlier works, Théodred was not the son of Théoden, but of Théoden's brother instead.[6]
In the first version, Théodred's death had been January 25, a day before Boromir's death and the Breaking of the Fellowship.[7]

Elfwine was the son of Éomer and the nineteenth King of Rohan.

Contents[show]
Biography
Elfwine was the first son of King Éomer and Lothíriel, the daughter of Prince Imrahil of Dol Amroth. As Elfwine ruled in the Fourth Age after the Red Book of Westmarch had been written, not much is known about him or his deeds as a noble of Rohan, but he likely kept the ancient Oath of Eorl, maintaining the alliance of Rohan and Gondor. He became king in the year FO 63 upon his father's death and ruled long after.[1] Nothing further of his life is known.
He was said to have a striking resemblance to his maternal grandfather, Imrahil, the well-known Prince of Dol Amroth.[2]

Etymology
The name Elfwine is Old English, meaning ""Elf-friend"". His name is similar to Tolkien's Ælfwine of England.[3]

Imrahil, also known as Prince Imrahil, was the twenty-second Prince of Dol Amroth. He had two older sisters, Ivriniel and Finduilas. His daughter Lothiriel wedded Éomer, King of Rohan, in the last year of the Third Age.

Biography
During the War of the Ring, on March 9, 3019, Prince Imrahil led a company of Swan Knights and 700 men at arms to Minas Tirith to help defend the City. Prince Imrahil led the group that rode to the aid of Faramir and the rear-guard who were retreating from Osgiliath when the forces of Sauron overran the Pelennor Fields on March 13. Gandalf rode with them, and the Winged Nazgûl fled before him. The Knights of Dol Amroth rescued Faramir from the Southrons. Faramir was poisoned, and Imrahil carried his nephew back to the City on his horse. Gandalf then took command of the besieged city, and Prince Imrahil assisted him because Denethor in his madness retreated to the White Tower with his dying son, and forgot about the city.
While paying his respect to the procession bearing the body of King Théoden of Rohan at the Battle of the Pelennor Fields on March 15, Imrahil noticed that the Rohirrim also bore the body of Éowyn. He perceived that she was still alive and he sent a man to the City for help.
Éomer and his Riders were outnumbered, but Imrahil then rode into battle and came to their aid. Shortly after, Aragorn arrived in the black ships of the Corsairs and the tide of the battle was turned. After the Pelennor fields had been cleared, Aragorn, Éomer and Imrahil rode to the Gate of Minas Tirith.
Imrahil recognized that Aragorn was the rightful King, but he agreed that it was wise for Aragorn to wait to enter the city because Imrahil knew his brother-in-law Denethor was strong-willed and proud. When Imrahil learned that Denethor was dead and Faramir was dying, he suggested that Aragorn be summoned, remembering that the Kings of old were great healers. Aragorn came at Gandalf's request to heal the wounded Faramir, Éowyn, and Merry, but he declared that Prince Imrahil should rule the City until Faramir awoke, in effect granting Imrahil the position of Steward.
During the debate of the Captains of the West, Gandalf proposed that they march to the Black Gate to distract Sauron's attention from Frodo the Ring-bearer. Imrahil said that he would follow his liege Aragorn, but since Minas Tirith was under his command the Prince advised that some should remain to defend the City. In the end it was decided that an army of 7,000 would ride forth. Imrahil laughed and said:
""Surely this is the greatest jest in all the history of Gondor: that we should ride with seven thousands, scarce as many as the vanguard of its army in the days of its power, to assail the mountains and the impenetrable gate of the Black Land! So might a child threaten a mail-clad knight with a bow of string and green willow!"" (The Return of the King: ""The Last Debate"")
The Host of the West left Minas Tirith on March 18. Bypassing Minas Morgul and marching north, the heralds announced the coming of King Elessar at Imrahil's advice. When Sauron's forces emerged from the Black Gate on March 25, Imrahil stood on the front line with his men. They fought the Battle of the Black Gate until the One Ring was destroyed.
Prince Imrahil was present at the celebrations of the Field of Cormallen, and the coronation of Aragorn as King Elessar, and rode with the funeral procession of King Théoden to Rohan, remaining in Edoras after the King's burial on August 10. Imrahil and Éomer became great friends, and in TA 3021 Éomer wed Imrahil's daughter Lothíriel.[1]
After the War of the Ring, Prince Imrahil and his nephew Prince Faramir were King Elessar's chief commanders. Imrahil was also part of the Great Council of Gondor, and remained an adviser of the King.
Prince Imrahil died in the year 34 of the Fourth Age, and was succeed by his eldest son Elphir, who continued the line of Princes.[2]

 Biography 
    Finduilas in Nargothrond, by Melkoron  
Finduilas was the daughter of Orodreth and his unnamed wife, a lady of the Northern Sindar.[2] Her date of birth and birthplace are unknown.[note 1] She was betrothed to Gwindor, who named her Faelivrin.[3][4]
In 472 of the First Age [1], Gwindor was captured during the Nírnaeth Arnoediad by Morgoth, and when he returned in FA 490 he came with a companion who called himself Agarwaen son of Umarth (the Bloodstained, son of Ill-Fate). Unbeknownst to Finduilas, this was actually Túrin, son of Húrin. Despite her old feelings for Gwindor, Finduilas fell in love with Túrin, but Túrin refused her in respect for his friend. Gwindor realized this, and revealed Túrin's name to Finduilas and tried to let Túrin fall in love with Finduilas, since he realized Finduilas loved Túrin instead of him.[3][4]
After the failure of the Battle of Tumhalad, Glaurung and an army of Orcs sacked Nargothrond. Gwindor was slain and when Túrin returned to Nargothrond he was caught in a trance by the dragon who spoke to him of his kin in Hithlum, rendering him deaf to the cries of Finduilas as a party of Orcs dragged her past him as a captive intended for Angband.[5]
Glaurung's deceit caused Túrin to abandon Finduilas and instead go to Hithlum in search of his kin. By the time he finally went to search for Finduilas she was dead, for she had been killed when the Orcs guarding her were waylaid by the Haladin of Brethil at the Crossings of Taeglin. Before their defeat the Orcs had killed all their captives, nailing Finduilas to a tree with a spear. The people of Haladin buried her in a mound they called Haudh-en-Elleth, Mound of the Elf Maiden.[3][6][7]

 Etymology 
Finduilas comes from the Sindarin elements fin (""hair""), a common prefix in the House of Finwë [8], duil, which may have come from the ethuil (""spring""), and las (""leaf"").
Her epessë Faelivrin means ""Gleam of the Sun on the Pools of Ivrin"" from the Sindarin fael (""gleam, brilliance"").

Celebrimbor was a Ñoldorin prince, and the last in the line of the House of Fëanor, who lived in Middle-earth. He was a ruler of Eregion in the Second Age, and a master smith. He is remembered primarily for his creation of the three greatest Elven Rings of Power: Vilya, Narya, and Nenya.

 Biography 
 First Age 
    Celebrimbor as a child with his parents in Valinor, by Filat  
Celebrimbor was the son of Curufin, who was the fifth son of Fëanor (son of Finwë and his first wife Miriel) and Nerdanel.[3] During the First Age, he lived with his father in Nargothrond, but took no part in the deeds of Curufin and Celegorm regarding Lúthien, Beren, and Finrod. He in fact repudiated his father's deeds, and did not follow his father and uncle when they were expelled from Nargothrond.[4]

 Second Age 
    Celebrimbor and Annatar forging the Rings  
Celebrimbor settled in Eregion in the Second Age and started dealing with the Dwarves of the realm of Khazad-dûm. In SA 1500, Sauron, calling himself Annatar (""Lord of Gifts""), befriended the Ñoldor of Eregion. He claimed to be an emissary of the Valar, especially Aulë, and instructed them in the art of ring-making.[5] Celebrimbor distrusted him, but the smiths of Eregion were deceived. Under the guidance and instruction of Sauron, the smiths openly made rings to learn the craft, but unknown to them the craft taught by Sauron incorporated a binding magic into the rings.
In secret, Sauron forged the One Ring, a master ring that would rule all the lesser rings, to enable him to rule Middle-earth via its influence over those who used the other rings. When Sauron placed the One Ring on his finger, claiming dominance over all the Rings of Power and their bearers, the elves knew his true identity and intentions. Celebrimbor and the elves of Eregion defied Sauron by withholding the other rings from him. The greatest of the rings (aside from the One Ring) were created by Celebrimbor himself, and these were never touched by Sauron and thus were uncorrupted by him, although they were still subject to the One Ring. These were the three Rings of the Elves, the fairest of the Rings of Power. Celebrimbor named them Vilya, Narya, and Nenya after the principal Middle-earth elements of air, fire and water, respectively. He sent the three rings away for safekeeping: Vilya and Narya to Gil-galad in Lindon; and Nenya to Galadriel in Lórien.

    The death of Celebrimbor  
Sauron retaliated by attacking Eregion, laying waste to the realm. Celebrimbor was captured in the chaos and was forced, under torture, to disclose where the lesser rings were, but he would not reveal the whereabouts of the three greatest of them that he had sent away for safekeeping. Celebrimbor died from his torment; his body was shot with arrows and hung upon a pole, and was later paraded as a banner as Sauron attacked the elves.[6] He was the last direct descendant of the line of Fëanor, save perhaps for his father's brother Maglor, whose fate is unknown and is said by some legends to still wander the shores of the Sea. It is unknown whether he married or had children.

 Etymology 
His father-name was Telperinquar, which means ""Silver-fist"" or ""Hand of silver"" in Quenya. It comes from the words telpë (""silver"") and quár (""fist""). His mother-name remains unknown. The name Celebrimbor is the Sindarin translation of his father-name, which comes from celeb (""silver"") and baur (""fist"").[7][8]

 Character 
Unlike both his father and his grandfather, Celebrimbor was portrayed as being both selfless and kind, and was neither prideful nor covetous of that which he created. He was described to have an ""almost Dwarvish obsession with crafts"";[6] he became a famous artificer and smith in both Gondolin and Eregion. His love for crafts took him to Eregion, where he was introduced to a precious metal and called it Mithril. Mithril was mined by Dwarves in their nearby Mine Realm of Khazad-dum, later named Moria. Great friendship with the Dwarves of Moria developed, and skills and secrets were shared between the two peoples for many years via The High Road which was built between the two realms. But a long period of peace would not last, for upon realizing the trap which Sauron had devised for him, Celebrimbor was filled with anxiety and fear for his people, and was later described as the heroic defender of Eregion.[9]

Curufin, also called Curufin the Crafty,[3] was a Ñoldorin prince and the fifth of the seven Sons of Fëanor and Nerdanel. Curufin was the father of Celebrimbor, master Jewel-smith of Eregion who would later forge the three Elvish Rings of Power.
Among his seven brothers, Curufin was his father's favorite and was most like his father in skill of hand and in appearance.[4]

 Biography 
    Curufin with his wife and his son, Celebrimbor in Valinor, by Filat  
Curufin was born in Valinor sometime in during the Noontide of Valinor. There he married an unnamed Elf (most likely one of the Ñoldor) and had a son they named Celebrimbor, who would later follow Curufin to exile.[2] As with all the Elves of Aman, they lived in peace and prosperity until the release of Melkor, the murder of Finwë and the theft of the Silmarils that led to the Flight of the Noldor.[5]
As with the other Sons of Fëanor, Curufin was bound by an oath to recover his father's Silmarils, which had been stolen by the Dark Lord Morgoth. His oath took him and his brothers to Middle-earth during the First Age.[5]
Arriving in Middle-earth, Fëanor roused Curufin and others who were most obedient to him, and set the swan-ships aflame.  Later, Curufin and his brothers fought in the Dagor-nuin-Giliath but lost their father Fëanor.[6]
Curufin and his older brother Celegorm (and possibly Celebrimbor) lived in Himlad, east of his brother Maedhros' fortress Himring and south of Aglon, a Pass between Himring and Dorthonion, leading into Doriath.[7] Around this time, their cousin Aredhel left Gondolin in search for both sons of Fëanor. However, Curufin and Celegorm were not in their lands when she arrived, thus Aredhel left and traveled south and was lost in Nan Elmoth. Years later, Aredhel and her son Maeglin left Nan Elmoth, and Eöl traveled after them, only to be brought to Curufin. Though they had no love for him and scorned him, they did not slay him and allowed him to continue on his way.[8]
The two brothers fortified their realms with great strength and held them until the Dagor Bragollach, by which time it was forced. However, following the Dagor Bragollach, the two brothers were defeated and had to flee with their people to Nargothrond, where Finrod welcomed them.[9]

    Curufin with his brother Celegorm in Nargothrond, by Jenny Dolfen at goldseven.de  
Shortly after, Beren also came to Nargothrond to remind Finrod of the oath he had sworn, and claim his help. Finrod decided to help Beren, but Celegorm and Curufin, remembering their Oath, persuaded the people of Nargothrond not to follow him, and not to wage open war against Morgoth, making them fearful. Finrod therefore had to leave with a handful of warriors, including Beren, and later died. His nephew Orodreth was made to rule in his stead.[10][note 1]
He and his brother went hunting with Celegorm's hound Huan, then found Lúthien, daughter of Thingol, as she fled to find Beren. Feigning to help her, they took her captive and brought her to Nargothrond, for Celegorm had become enamoured and would have Thingol give him her hand. However, Huan helped Lúthien to flee, and they freed Beren and other thralls from Sauron. As these thralls returned, the people of Nargothrond perceived the two brothers' treachery, and though Orodreth would not let them be slain, he cast them from Nargothrond.

    Curufin and Celegorm flee on horseback, as depicted by Alan Lee  
The two brothers met Lúthien and Beren as they fled, and Curufin fought with Beren losing the knife Angrist in the struggle. Defeated, he had to flee with Celegorm, but sought to slay Lúthien even as he did, and shot Beren instead.[10]
Due to Celegorm and Curufin's deeds, Thingol and Orodreth would lend no aid to Maedhros as he sought to unite Elves, Dwarves, and Men in what was called the Union of Maedhros.[11]
Curufin fell in the Second Kinslaying, when the Sons of Fëanor attacked Doriath to seize a Silmaril in the possession of the Elvish King Dior the Beautiful. His brothers Celegorm and Caranthir died with him during the assault.[12]

 Etymology 
His father-name is Curufinwë means ""Skilled (son of) Finwë"" from the Quenyan curu (""Skill"").[13][14] The name Curufinwë is also Fëanor's original name. This was because Curufin was most like his father both in appearance, temperament and skill. His mother-name is Atarinkë (""Little Father"") for he resembled his father in both mind and talent. He was called Kurvo by his family members.[4]

 Other names 
Tolkien provided Old English names for his characters. For Curufin, the name Cyrefinn Fácensearo was given, from the Old English words cyre (""choice""), facen (""deceit, guile, wickedness""), saeru (""skill""), and fácensaeru (""treachery"").[15]

As founder of the House of Finwë, he and his first and second wives were the sires of the three noble houses of Fëanor, Fingolfin, Finarfin who afterwards ruled great realms in Middle-earth, and succeeded him in Aman. His bloodline also mixed its way into the race of Men as well.   
Finwë was perhaps one of the firstborn Elves (created solely from Eru Ilúvatar himself) who awoke in Cuiviénen.

 Biography 
    Finwë and Elwë in Cuiviénen before the Great Journey to Aman, by  Kazuki-Mendou  
Finwë was born or perhaps awoke in Middle-earth in the far eastern land of Cuiviénen during the Years of the Trees. When the Vala Oromë found the Elves during his travels in Middle-earth, he loved them and urged them to travel with him to Valinor to see its wondrous beauty. The Elves however, were suspicious of this call and were afraid and so Oromë chose ambassadors to represent the three Elven-kindreds: the Vanyar, the Ñoldor, and the Teleri, to represent their kindreds and to return and report what they had saw. One of them was Finwë who along with Ingwë and Elwë went to the Blessed Realm with Oromë. When they returned, they were able to convince the Elves to go on the Great Journey into the far west.
There was great friendship between Finwë of the Ñoldor and Elwë of the Teleri. Then each became leaders of their own Elven-kindred. Thus, Finwë became the Lord of the Ñoldor who led his people on the Great Journey. And eventually, Finwë and his people the Ñoldor arrived in Valinor directly behind the Vanyar. There he and his people settled and Finwë thus became the First High King of the Ñoldor.

    Finwe near his wife Miriel Serinde, by Steamey  
Finwë started a family first marrying Míriel Serindë who had also come with her people the Ñoldor to Aman. They had a son called Fëanor but her labors in giving birth to him drained her of most of her life, and she died shortly after bearing him. After a period of mourning he married again. His second wife was Indis of the Vanyar. Indis bore him four children: Fingolfin, Finarfin, Findis, and Irimë.
When Melkor, now free from the Halls of Mandos began spreading lies amongst the Ñoldor attempting to corrupt them, Finwë attempted to moderate his people and lead them back to the Valar. But it was too late, the Ñoldor had already begun to envision for themselves plans and new dominions they could have ruled back in Middle-earth and were proud. However, Fëanor mistrusted the Valar and believed the lies and began to horde his treasures and would only allow his beloved father or his sons to see the Silmarils. He also begun to suspect his half-brother was trying to usurp him as the favored son, and made trouble in Tirion drawing his sword on Fingolfin. For this he was banished from the city, but Finwë loved his elder son greatly and shared his exile and went with him northward and built the city/fortress of Formenos.
There Finwë lived with his son and his grandchildren and some of the rest of his house. Later, when Fëanor was summoned to Valmar to make peace with his brother, Finwë did not go out of bitterness over the exile of his son nor did he wish to meet the rest of his people because he no longer felt like their king. There he was the first to be killed in Valinor when Melkor slew him at the doors of Formenos seeking the Silmarils. This act was the catalyst that led to the Revolt of the Ñoldor.[2][3]

 Etymology 
Finwë's name is not fully translated. The glossary in the Silmarillion translates Fin as ""hair""; other sources say it means ""skill"".[4]

Celegorm, called Celegorm the Fair[3], was the third son of Fëanor and Nerdanel, most closely associated with another brother, Curufin. He is somewhat anomalously described as having fair hair, rather than the black or red hair of his parents and his six siblings.
Celegorm was a great huntsman, and a friend of the Vala Oromë. From Oromë he learned great skill of birds and beasts, and could understand a number of their languages. He had brought with him from Valinor the great hound Huan, a gift from Oromë.

Contents[show]
 Biography 
    Tyelkormo by Tuuliky  
Celegorm was born in Valinor sometime during the Noontide of Valinor. He was very close to Oromë and probably hunted with him in his woods.[3]
After the theft of the Silmarils and the death of their grandfather, he and his father and his brothers took an oath to recover them at any cost. Celegorm, bound to his oath came to Middle-earth and established great realms in exile and joined with their relatives in the House of Fingolfin, and waged war against the armies of Morgoth.[4][5] Celegorm and his brother were great lords in the land of Himlad.[6] They were defeated and overwhelmed by the successful sudden assault of Morgoth during the Dagor Bragollach. Celegorm and Curufin lost Himlad and fled south to the marches of Doriath. Not being welcome there due to the Kinslaying at Alqualondë, Celegorm, Curufin, and their people settled in Nargothrond.[7]
While he and his brother lived in Nargothrond, they captured Lúthien Tinúviel, daughter of King Thingol of Doriath. Celegorm wished to marry her, thus forcing a bond of kinship with Thingol. Huan, however, broke with his master and helped Lúthien escape, foiling his scheme. Afterwards, he and his brother were expelled from Nargothrond.[8] Celegorm fell at Menegroth in the Second Kinslaying when the Sons of Fëanor attacked Doriath to seize a Silmaril in the possession of King Dior of Doriath. Celegorm was slain by Dior in the halls of Menegroth.[9]

 Etymology 
His father-name was Turcafinwë (""Strong [in body] Finwë). His mother-name was Tyelkormo (""Hasty-riser""), from the Quenya word tyelka (""hasty""), possibly in references to his quick temper and habit of leaping when angered.[10]

Lúthien, also known as Tinúviel, was an Elf maiden of Doriath, the wife of Beren Erchamion, and the most beautiful of all the Children of Ilúvatar to ever live. Her love of the mortal Edain Beren, for which she was prepared to risk everything, including her life, was legendary and lamented forever in song and story. She and Beren braved Morgoth's horrors, eventually winning the Silmaril and the respect of Thingol. Though their actions later resulted in both their deaths, their deeds won them the pity of Mandos and a second life in Middle-earth. [2] Her romance with Beren was one of the great stories of the Elder Days that were told for many ages after she lived.

 Biography 
 Early years 

And thus in anguish Beren paid
for that great doom upon him laid,
the deathless love of Lúthien,
too fair for love of mortal Men;
and in his doom was Lúthien snared,
the deathless in his dying shared;
and Fate them forged a binding chain
of living love and mortal pain.
— The Lays of Beleriand, ""The Doom of Lúthien""

Lúthien was the daughter of Elu Thingol, King of Doriath, and his Queen, Melian the Maia.[note 1] Throughout the years before she met Beren, she lived as all the Elves of Doriath did: in a state of perfect blissful peace. She was a woman of incomparable beauty and grace, with night-dark hair, sparkling grey eyes, luminous skin, and a clear heartbreakingly lovely voice that was said to cause winter to melt into spring - ""the song of Luthien released the bonds of winter, and the frozen waters spoke, and flowers sprang from the cold earth where her feet had passed"". She also often enjoyed dancing in the woods of the realm to the music of her good friend Daeron's flute. He himself soon came to love her jealously, but she did not return it.
 The Quest for the Silmaril 
    Beren fell in love when he saw Lúthien dance  
Lúthien was remembered in the Lay of Leithian as the first Elven woman to have fallen in love and married a mortal man, Beren, a Man of the House of Bëor whom she met in the woods of Doriath. Their relationship was unlikely from the beginning: Lúthien was not only the cherished single daughter of the most powerful Elven King in Beleriand, but also the daughter of a Maia, a powerful angelic being of the race of the Ainur. Beren was a mortal man on the run from the first Dark Lord Morgoth.

    Beren lies dying in Lúthien's arms, by Gustavo Malek  
Thingol was desperate not to let Beren marry his daughter, and set an impossible task as the bride price: Beren had to bring to Thingol one of the Silmarils from Morgoth's iron crown. Against monstrous odds, being kidnapped by the Sons of Fëanor and the death of Finrod Felagund, as well as a confrontation with Sauron, the couple achieved the task with help from Huan, the Hound of Valinor, but Beren died as soon as it was completed. In grief, Lúthien lay down and died, passing to the Halls of Mandos. There, in her grief, she sang to Mandos. Her song was of such beauty that Mandos, for the first and only time in his existence, was moved to pity. But Mandos had no authority to allow Beren to live again, so he went before Manwë for advice, who in turn sought out the counsel of Eru Ilúvatar himself. Two choices were then placed before Lúthien; she could either dwell in Valimar with the Valar in bliss forever as reward for all that she had accomplished, or she could be restored to life again with Beren, on the condition that they would both be mortal and die the death of Men. For her love of Beren, Luthien chose the latter.[2]

 Later years 
    Lúthien sings before Mandos  
After this, she became a mortal and returned to Middle-earth with Beren, and lived briefly in Tol Galen. They had a son, Dior, who was called Elúchil, the Heir of Thingol.[3]
After the sack of Menegroth, Beren returned there and ambushed the dwarves and took Nauglamir back to Luthien. Her beauty combined with the splendor of the gem and necklace to make her home of Tol Galen the fairest land ever to have existed east of Valinor. On her death the Nauglamír was delivered to her son Dior, which led to the ruin of Doriath.[4]

 Legacy 
The union of Beren and Lúthien was the first between a mortal Man and an Elven maid. Their lineage passed down to the royal House of Elros of the Kingdom of Númenor, and then on to the Dúnedain, men living in exile in Middle-earth, and on to the Kings of the Reunited Kingdom and beyond. Lúthien's romance with Beren is one of the great stories of the Elder Days, and is mirrored by the later romance between Aragorn and Arwen Evenstar. According to legend, her line would never be broken as long as the world lasted.[2]

 Etymology 
The name Lúthien means ""Daughter of Flowers"", from the Sindarin luth (""flower"").[5] In Doriathrin, Luthien and Noldorin Lhūthien means ""enchantress"", which is derived from luktiēnē (""enchantress"").[6] Lúthien may have been derived from the Old English word Lufien, which means ""love"".
Tinúviel means ""Nightingale"", from the Quendian tindōmiselde [note 2]. In Sindarin, it means ""Daughter of Twilight"", from tinnu (""dusk, twilight"") and the feminine suffix -ien (""daughter"").[6]

 Background 
Lúthien is supposed to have been based on Edith Tolkien, J.R.R. Tolkien's wife. The first tale she appeared in, The Tale of Tinúviel, was in part inspired by Edith and John Ronald's forest walks, in 1917, in Roos, England - as Beren first saw and fell in love with Lúthien in the woods.[7]
Edith Tolkien was buried in Wolvercote Cemetery (North Oxford), and this writing in on her plaque:
EDITH MARY TOLKIEN - LUTHIEN 1889–1971
The name of Beren appears on J.R.R. Tolkien's plaque:
JOHN RONALD REUEL TOLKIEN - BEREN 1892 – 1973

 Earlier versions 
In various versions of The Tale of Tinúviel, Tolkien's earliest form of Lúthien's tale later published in The Book of Lost Tales Part One, Lúthien's name is Tinúviel, Beren is an Elf, and the character Sauron has not yet emerged. In his place, they face Tevildo, the Prince of Cats, a monstrous giant cat.

Melian (Sindarin IPA: [ˈmeljan]) was a Maia of the race of the Ainur, Queen of Doriath and mother of Lúthien Tinúviel. Melian was fourth greatest and most powerful of all the Maiar.

Contents[show]
 Biography 
Before she came to Middle-earth, Melian served both Vána and Estë, and dwelt in Lórien tending the trees that grew in the Gardens of Irmo. Among all of her people none were wiser (with the exception of Ilmarë, Arien and Uinen ), more beautiful, or more skilled in singing enchanting songs than Melian. She loved the deep shadows of the great trees. When the light of the Two Trees would mingle Melian would sing and the Valar would stop their work and listen. Nightingales went with her wherever she went, and she taught them their song. Of all the Valar she was most akin to Yavanna. When the Elves awoke on the shore of Cuiviénen she departed from Valinor and went to Middle-earth, where she filled its silence with her singing and the singing of her birds.

    Melian encounters Elwë the woods of Nan Elmoth, by WilderWein77  
While in the forest of Nan Elmoth she met and fell in love with the Elven-king Elu Thingol, and later she ruled the kingdom of Doriath by his side. For thousands of years, she used her powers to guard and defend the city with a protection spell called the Girdle of Melian, but she predicted that one person would one day breach this defense. The Girdle functioned to bewilder any who attempted to enter Doriath, and was so potent that even Ungoliant was unable to bypass it. She and her husband had a child, a daughter named Lúthien. During her stay in Doriath she became a friend and mentor of Galadriel. Melian wanted to know the cause of the exile of the Ñoldor. Galadriel only briefly narrated the story to her, leaving out the death of Finwë, the Kinslaying at Alqualondë, and the burning of the ships at Losgar. But eventually she and Thingol learned the truth.
Melian's main line of descent is of the Half-elven, and through her daughter the Maian blood passed to both Elves and Men. When Beren arrived as foretold, she counseled Thingol against sending Beren for a Silmaril, a quest which would eventually lead to Doriath's ruin. A friend of Mankind, she also aided Húrin's family by hosting Túrin in Doriath and later helped Beleg Cúthalion in his search for Túrin by giving him Lembas. When Húrin came to Doriath old and carrying a great grief and misery on him, Melian helped him see through his ills. After Thingol's death she left Doriath, visiting Beren and Lúthien for a time warning them of the Dwarves treachery, and the curse on the Mîm's treasure. Shortly there-after, she went back to Valinor, musing upon her sorrows in the gardens of Lorien whence she came.[1]

 Etymology 
Melian is Sindarin, from the Quenya Melyanna, of which the roots are mel (love) and anna (gift). The name means ""dear gift."" Earlier versions of Melian's name were Gwenniel and Gwenethlin.[2] Beren and Lúthien (2017) reintroduces the names Gwendeling and Gwendelin into the 'complete story'.
Her rare title-name Tóril is a word for ""Queen.""

Eru was the supreme deity of Arda. He was the single creator, above the Valar, but delegated almost all direct action within Eä to the Ainur, including the shaping of the world.

Contents[show]
Biography
Eru was transcendent, completely outside of and beyond the world. He first created a group of angelic beings, called in Elvish the ""Ainur,"" and these holy spirits were co-actors in the creation of Arda through a holy music and chanting called the ""Music of the Ainur."" He is known also as ""the All-Powerful"", and he alone could create independent life, or reality, using the ""Flame Imperishable"".
The next thing he fashioned was Eä, the ""World and All That Is"", and Eä was in the Void (or ""the Outside"" is it was sometimes called). He then gave the Ainur the option to go into Eä and fashion it as they will. The Greatest Ainur who chose to do so were called the Valar, and they controlled the shaping of the Arda. They could not make life, however, as Aulë proves, who was able to give only shape to the Dwarves, while consciousness was given to them by Eru. The Valar were accompanied by the Maiar, the lesser Ainur. Elves and mankind, however, came directly from Ilúvatar's thoughts, and are referred to in The Silmarillion as the ""First"" and ""Second"" Children of Ilúvatar (or Eruhini), respectively.
Eru is an important part of the stories of The Silmarillion but is not mentioned by name in Tolkien's most famous works, The Hobbit and The Lord of the Rings (He is alluded to as ""the One"" in a part of Appendix A that speaks of the downfall of Númenor).

Interventions
 During the Years of the Trees, Eru created and awoke Men.

 In the Second Age Eru, called upon by the Valar, buried King Ar-Pharazôn and his Army when they landed at Aman in SA 3319. He caused the Earth to take a round shape, drowned Númenor, and caused the Undying Lands to be taken ""outside the spheres of the Earth"".
 In a letter written by Tolkien, he stated that Eru again intervened, this time in the Third Age, causing Gollum to trip and fall into the fires of Mount Doom while still holding the One Ring, thus destroying it.

Etymology
Eru meant ""The One"" or ""Alone"", and the epithet Ilúvatar meant ""Father of All"" in the Quenya tongue.

Wolves of Valinor (Great Wolves)



Huan was a great wolfhound of the First Age. He was given by the Vala Oromë the Hunter to his friend Celegorm, one of the Sons of Fëanor. Huan was as large as a small horse, and accompanied Celegorm on his huntings. When the Ñoldor under Fëanor rebelled, Huan went with his master to Middle-earth.[2]
Huan had been granted special powers by the Valar, and was allowed to speak three times before he died. It was also prophesied that he could not be killed unless it was by the greatest wolf that ever lived.

 Biography 
    Celegorm with Huan in Valinor, by Filat  
Huan was originally a Hound of Oromë in Valinor and was eventually given to Celegorm, Fëanor's third son. He went into exile with his master during the Flight of the Ñoldor. He might have stayed with his master in Himlad and later fled with him to Nargothrond after their defeat in the Dagor Bragollach.[3]
He became involved with the Quest for the Silmaril. When Beren had left Lúthien and gone with Finrod Felagund to Angband but had been captured in Tol-in-Gaurhoth, Lúthien set out to rescue him. She was intercepted by Celegorm and Curufin, who were living in Nargothrond at the time and were hunting. Huan smelt Lúthien and captured her, and she was brought before Celegorm. Celegorm and Curufin did not reveal to her that they had sent Beren to his death by the hand of Sauron, and took her as a prisoner to Nargothrond, ""for her own protection"", secretly plotting to wed her to Celegorm and thereby force an alliance with Lúthien's father Thingol.[2]

    Huan subdues Sauron, by Ted Nasmith  
Huan felt pity for Lúthien, and sought her out. Speaking for the first time, he told her of a way to escape, using a secret exit,[4] and then accompanied her to Tol-in-Gaurhoth[5] where, with the help of Lúthien's magic, he killed all of Sauron's werewolves until Sauron himself came out, knowing of the prophesy about Huan's death he took the shape of the greatest wolf that had ever lived up to that point. Huan nevertheless managed to defeat him, and Sauron was forced to flee. Huan went back to his master, while Lúthien and Beren went on their way back to Doriath, they came across Celegorm and Curufin once more, who had been exiled from Nargothrond by Orodreth when he learned of their deeds. Curufin tried to kill Lúthien, but Huan turned against his master, defending Beren and Lúthien.[2][5]

    Huan lunging at Carcharoth  
Speaking for the second time, Huan told Beren and Lúthien of his plan to gain entrance to Angband, bringing them the skin of the werewolf Draugluin and the bat-skin of Sauron's messenger Thuringwethil. Using these skins as disguise Beren and Lúthien went to Angband, while Huan hunted in the wild.[2]
After Beren and Lúthien had won the Silmaril but Beren had lost his hand to the werewolf Carcharoth, Huan joined Beren, Thingol, Beleg Cúthalion and Mablung in the Hunt for the Wolf. Huan and Beren managed to kill Carcharoth, but Huan was mortally wounded. Speaking for the third and last time, he wished Beren and Lúthien farewell, and died.[2]

 Etymology 
Huan literally means ""great dog, hound"",[6] deriving from the Sindarin hû (""hound"").[7]
In Quenya, Huan also means ""hound"", which comes from the word khugan or hunen.[8]

 Other versions of the legendarium 
In earlier texts, Huan was described to be the ""Captain of Dogs"" and a rival to Tevildo (later Sauron), the Prince of Cats. Here, Huan met Tinuviel (Lúthien), who was initially afraid and fled from him. With his speed Huan overtook her in two leaps and spoke ""soft and deep the tongue of the Lost Elves"".[9]
There was also a mention of Huan being a possible Maia, along with Sorontar (Thorondor).[10]
Some of this storyline is re-adapted back into Beren and Lúthien (2017) for the 'complete tale'.

 Behind the Scenes 
Although his appearance is never described, he may have been seen as one of the Wolfhounds of Irish tradition (i.e. an Irish Wolfhound). There is also a certain allegory in The Quest of the Silmaril to The Divine Comedy: The Inferno by Dante Alighieri, as Dante's path to Heaven is blocked by a wolf. This Wolf will only be challenged by a Grayhound, who will drag it back to Hell. However, in illustrations, he resembles an ordinary dog/wolf mix.

","Ungoliant (Sindarin IPA: [uŋˈɡoljant] - ""Dark Spider"") was a primordial taking the shape of a gigantic spider. She was initially an ally of Melkor in Aman, and for a short time in Middle-earth as well. She was a distant mother of Shelob, and the oldest and first giant spider of Arda. 

Contents[show]
 Biography 
 Origins 
    Ungoliant and the Two Trees  
The true origin of Ungoliant is unknown, and was not even known by the Valar. It is said that she came from the Darkness itself that lay about Arda and was once an ally of Melkor when he looked down upon the world with envy.

 Early years 
When Melkor was defeated and imprisoned by the Lords of the West after the first Elves awoke in Cuiviénen, Ungoliant escaped the attacks of the Valar and the hunters of Oromë and fled to the southern part of Aman. There, in a ravine south of the mountain Hyarmentir, she established her dark abode and took the physical form of a monstrous spider, and craved and sucked up all light she could find. After each feeding, she spun dark webs of gloom that strangled all passing light.[1]

 Alliance with Melkor 
Eventually, Melkor sought out Ungoliant in order to exact his revenge against the Valar and the Elves. He came to her in Avathar and told her of his plans. Though she was tempted greatly by Melkor's plan for her to drink the light of the Two Trees of Valinor, she feared the power of the Valar and was hesitant to accompany him. To mollify her, Melkor offered to sate her hunger with whatever she wished if she would aid him. She agreed, and they came shortly thereafter to Ezellohar, where she drained the Trees of their sap, poisoned them, and drank the Wells of Varda dry. The Unlight produced by Ungoliant stymied the pursuit of Oromë and Tulkas, and Melkor escaped to Middle-earth with her. However, her consumption of power of the Trees and the Wells caused her to swell to a size and shape so vast and hideous that even Melkor began to grow afraid.[1]    Ungoliant attacks Morgoth  
    The Balrogs of Morgoth attack Ungoliant  
When they arrived in Lammoth in Middle-earth, Melkor, now known as Morgoth, hoped to escape to the ruins of Angband where the remnants of his forces awaited him. Suspecting that he intended to leave his promise to her unfulfilled, Ungoliant demanded the gems that Morgoth had stolen from Formenos before they could reach Angband. She devoured them, and grew to an even more monstrous size. She then demanded that Morgoth surrender to her the Silmarils. However, Morgoth refused, and she attacked him. Weaving her dark webs, she attempted to enmesh him in her nets and take the Silmarils by force. Morgoth gave out a terrible cry of pain as she attacked, which was heard by the Balrogs hibernating under the ruins of Angband. They awoke and immediately rushed to the aid of their Lord, tearing apart Ungoliant's webbing with their fiery whips and forcing her to break off her attack. She fled, and the Balrogs prepared to pursue and destroy her, but they were checked by Morgoth, who ordered them to return with him to Angband.
Ungoliant's attack on Morgoth left an echoing scream ever after on the land, giving the area the name Lammoth, where it was said that any clamor would echo back from surrounding hills with his voice.[2]

 Final years and Legacy 
Driven off by the Balrogs, Ungoliant fled to Nan Dungortheb where she bred with the Great Spiders that dwelt there, increasing the terror and power of her kind. The creatures that later infested the area were her surviving offspring and descendants[2], including Shelob who dwelt from the Second and Third Ages onwards on the borders of Mordor, as her last surviving child.[3] It is said that Ungoliant ultimately perished at her own hands when, in her ever-growing hunger, she eventually devoured herself.[2]

 Etymology 
The Sindarin name Ungoliant in Quenya is Ungweliantë, meaning ""Dark Spider"" from ungwë (""dark"") and liantë (""spider"").[4]
The Eldar called her Virilomë (Wirilomë in Vanyarin) or Gloomweaver.[5] In Sindarin, this name is translated into Gwerlum.[6]

 Earlier versions of the legendarium 
In the state of the mythology in 1916 when J.R.R. Tolkien had gone to war, the first precursor to Ungoliant was Ungwë-Tuita, the 'Spider of Night' who once was close to ensnaring Eärendil and dwelt in Ruamorë.[7]

 Portrayal in adaptations 
 The Hobbit film trilogy 
Ungoliant was mentioned in Peter Jackson's The Hobbit: An Unexpected Journey when Radagast tells Gandalf about his encounter with the Great Spiders residing in Mirkwood, deducing that they are ""some kind of spawn of Ungoliant"".

Thorondor (Sindarin; IPA: ""Eagle Lord"") was the King of the Eagles of Middle-earth during the First Age.

Contents[show]
 Etymology 
The name Thorondor was Sindarin for ""Eagle Lord"", from the words thoron (""eagle"") and taur (""lord, king"").[2] The Quenya form of the same was Sorontar.[2][3]

 Appearance 
    Two of Thorondor's kin, as depicted in The Hobbit films  
Thorondor was presumably the greatest of all the Eagles in terms of size, with his wingspan measuring at 30 fathoms (180 feet or nearly 55 meters).[1]



 Biography 
    Thorondor and Fingon rescue Maedhros  
Thorondor was sent by Manwë, King of the Valar, to watch over the Ñoldor after they arrived in Beleriand. The Eldar first encountered him when he helped Fingon rescue Maedhros from imprisonment from Thangorodrim, upon which he had apparently made his home for a short time.[4] After that, Thorondor and the rest of the Eagles settled in the Crissaegrim. When Gondolin was built, Thorondor became the ever vigilant guardian of the city. He rescued Fingolfin's body from defilement after Morgoth killed him, giving the Dark Lord a scar on his face.[5] He, Landroval, and Gwaihir rescued Beren and Lúthien when Angband was aroused.[6]
When Gondolin fell, Thorondor rescued the survivors.[7] During the War of Wrath, Thorondor and Eärendil led the Eagles in battle with the Dragons, and may have fought with Ancalagon the Black.[8]

 Fate 
In Tolkien's writings, Thorondor is not mentioned after the War of Wrath. It is believed he returned to Valinor, although his descendants remained behind. Gwaihir became the Lord of Eagles in Middle-earth after Thorondor's departure.[citation needed]","

Ulmo (Quenya; IPA: [ˈulmo] - ""Pourer"" or ""Rainer"") - also known as Ulubôz or Ullubôz - was an Ainu, one of the Aratar, and the Vala responsible for the control over the oceans of Arda. A lover of water, Ulmo was one of the Arda's chief architects and was always in a close friendship with Manwë. He always distrusted Melkor, and the Dark Lord feared the Sea almost as much as he feared Varda because the sea cannot be tamed. Ulmo had no dwelling in Valinor or any permanent dwelling on land, as he preferred the deeps of the seas and the rivers. His palace, on the bottom of Vaiya, was called Ulmonan.

Contents[show]
Biography
Ulmo seldom came to the Councils of Máhanaxar, and only when in great need. He preferred to stay in Arda, not by walking on the land, as his form would fill man or elf with great dread. All waters were under his government: bays, rivers and even the waters under the earth. Where the power of Morgoth was strong, however, Ulmo's own power would be sapped from waters near to Morgoth's corruption. It is through the rivers that he kept in touch with Arda, and thus knew more of the goings on with the Children of Ilúvatar than even Manwë, for in that way he lived in the very veins of the world.
His visible form caused fear in mortals and even the Elves. In the Fall of Gondolin he was described as having a tall crown like silver, and his hair was like shimmering sea foam. He wore a grey cloak which appeared as a mist veiling a coat of mail which glittered like fish scales flickering green. And the horns he blew were called the Ulumúri.
Ulmo always loved the Eldar and the Edain, even when the Valar forsook Middle-earth. He opposed Oromë's plan to bring the elves to Aman, but helped those that were willing to reach it. He uprooted a large island which was later known as Tol Eressëa and used it to ferry them across the Belegaer to the Blessed Realm. Afterwards, he anchored it in the Bay of Eldamar, which he did because he knew the minds of the Teleri.
Ulmo was the Vala most responsible for the fall of Morgoth, by urging Turgon to build Gondolin and Finrod to build Nargothrond (FA 50). He appeared before Tuor and urged him to go to Gondolin as a messenger to Turgon. When he got there, he eventually married Turgon's daughter Idril and fathered Eärendil. Ulmo saved Eärendil's wife Elwing from the sack of the Havens of Sirion, allowing her to take a Silmaril to her husband, which allowed him to gain admittance to Valinor and plead for aid. Ulmo also defended them in the council from the potential wrath of Mandos.

Maiar of Ulmo
Ossë, the vassal of Ulmo who guarded the waters around Middle-earth.

Uinen, the wife of Ossë whose love for all sea creatures calmed the violent tidal waves and storms.

Salmar, the music performer of Ulmo who created the Ulumuri.

Uin, the ""primeval whale"" served under Ulmo. It is unknown whether this whale was actually an Ainur to have shape like other races of possible Ainur such as the Great Eagles.

Through these Maiar, Ulmo learned much of the Elves.[1]

Etymology
Ulmo means 'pourer' or 'rainer' in Quenya.

 Trivia 
He is the only male Vala never to have married.
Ulmo shares similarities with Poseidon, the god of the sea in Classical Graeco-Roman mythology.

Oromë (Quenya; IPA: [ˈorome] - ""Horn-Blower"" or ""Sound of Horns""), also known as Aldaron (Quenya; IPA: ""Horn-Blower""), Araw (Sindarin; IPA: ""Horn-Blower"") or Arômêz, was an Ainu, one of the Aratar and a Vala who was responsible for the hunt. He was the brother of Nessa and the husband of Vána.[3]

Contents[show]
Biography
    Oromë in Middle-earth  
During the Years of the Trees, after most of the Valar had withdrawn completely from Middle-earth and hidden themselves in Aman, Oromë still hunted in the forests of Middle-earth on occasion. Thus, it was he who discovered the Elves when they first awoke at Cuivienen and named them the Eldar [4]. Thereafter he remained close in friendship with them.
A powerful huntsman, he was active in the struggles against Morgoth. He had a great horn called the Valaróma and a great steed named Nahar.[3] Huan, a Hound from Valinor, once belonged to him but was later given to Celegorm, a son of Fëanor.[5]
In legend, Oromë is said to have first created the Rainbow or ""Bridge of Heaven"" using golden threads of Vána's hair, during the Hiding of Valinor.[6]

Etymology
Oromë means ""Horn-blowing"" and ""Sound of Horns"",[7] and is derived from the Valarin name Arômêz.[8]
Araw is the Sindarin translation of Oromë.[8] The Sindar additionally referred to him as Tauron, which means ""Lord of the Forests"" and ""The Forester.""[7] It is possible that the name comes from the Sindarin taur (""forest"") or the Quenyan taure (""great wood"").[9]

 Other names 
In the Old English translation of tales by Eriol, Oromë is called Wadfrea (""The Huntinglord""), Huntena frea (""Lord of Hunters""), and Wealdafrea (""Lord of Forests"").[10] Among the Rohirrim and other Northmen, he was also sometimes called Béma (Old English, originally Béaming; translating Tauron ""forest-lord"").[11]

 Character 
Oromë is described as being a mighty lord and a great huntsman, as he would often train his folk and beasts in pursue of evil creatures. He loved the lands of Middle-earth and was initially unwilling to leave it. He contrasts with the Vala Tulkas in demeanor; whereas Tulkas laughs in sports, Oromë is said to be dreadful in anger.[3]

 Maiar of Oromë 
 Tilion, the Maia who guided the Moon, was one of his Maiar in Valinor.

 Alatar and Pallando, the last two of the five wizards, were Maiar sent by Oromë to Middle-earth. What became of them is not known, although apparently they journeyed into the east with Saruman, but did not return.

 Earlier versions of the legendarium 
Oromë and his wife Vána were once envisioned to have had a daughter named Nielíqui.[12]

Mandos (Quenya; IPA: [ˈmandos] - ""Prison-Fortress"") was an Ainu, one of the Aratar, and a Vala who was responsible for the judgement of the Spirits (or Fëa) of all Elven dead. He also had responsibility for pronouncing the dooms and judgments of Eru Ilúvatar under Manwë. His real name was Námo (Quenya; IPA: ""Ordainer"" or ""Judge"") but was later known to the Elves as Mandos after his sacred Halls of Mandos, over which he presided, and where Elves would go when slain.
Mandos was the sixth greatest of the Lords of the Valar, and fifth greatest Aratar.[2]

 Biography 
    The Masters of Souls, by Jenny Dolfen  
Mandos was the brother of Irmo (Lórien) and Nienna in the mind of Eru Ilúvatar. He and his brother Lórien were the ""Fëanturi"", the Masters of Spirits. His wife was Vaire the Weaver.
It was he who pronounced Manwë's Doom concerning the espousals of the Eldar in YT 1172, when Finwë asked counsel for a second marriage, after the death of his wife's passing to the Halls of Mandos.[3]
When Melkor began marring Arda before the coming of the Elves, Tulkas arrived and wanted to make war swiftly. At the bidding of Manwë, Mandos pronounced the doom of the Firstborn. After the captivity of Melkor, Mandos had once again pronounced the Doom.[4] Melkor spent three Ages in the duress of Mandos thereafter,[5] guarded by his hound Gorgumoth in Lumbi.[6] Mandos judged Fëanor to leave Tirion for twelve years after Fëanor's drawing of sword against Fingolfin. After the destruction of the Two Trees, Yavanna asked for the light of the Silmarils, which Fëanor denied and he shall be slain, the first in Aman; but Mandos had spoken and revealed that Finwë was the first, having been slain at the steps of Formenos by Melkor. When the Ñoldor revolted against the Valar, Mandos appeared before them and pronounced the Doom of the Ñoldor.[7]

Finwë, the first to be slain in Aman, then approached Mandos in his halls and begged for his wife Miriel to return to life. In exchange Finwë could never be reincarnated like other elves, and had to remain in The Halls of Awaiting forever. Mandos granted Finwë his wish.[8]    The Halls of Mandos by ralphdamiani  Only once was he moved to pity, when Lúthien sang of the grief she and her lover Beren had experienced in Beleriand. Then, with the Elder King's approval, he released them to Middle-earth to begin their second life there as mortal beings with no certitude of life.[9]
When Eärendil arrived in Aman to beg for assistance from the Valar, Mandos considered Eärendil and Elwing's fate as Half-elven and gave them and their descendants a choice: either to be counted among Elves or Men.[10]

 Character 
Mandos, upon appearing before the Ñoldor, was referred to be a dark figure with a loud voice, solemn and terrible.[7]
He was described as being stern, dispassionate and never forgetting a thing. He was the Vala who cursed the Ñoldor leaving Aman, and counselled against allowing them to return. But unlike Morgoth, his Dooms are not cruel or vindictive by his own design. They are simply the will of Eru, and he will not speak them unless he is commanded to do so by Manwë.

 Etymology 
His common name Mandos means ""Prison-fortress"". It stems from Mandost (""castle of custody"") or mbando (""custody"") and osto (""fortified building or place"").[11]
His real name, Námo, means ""Ordainer"" or ""Judge"" in Quenya. 

 Other Names 
The Old English translation for Mandos is Nefrea ""Corpse-ruler"" from neo (""corpse"") and frea (""lord""). His title is Neoaerna hlaford (""Master of the houses of the dead"").[12] He was also called Morimando, the ""Dark Mando"", as opposed to Manwë's Kalamando, the ""Light Mando"".[13]
In Tolkien's earlier work, Mandos was named Vefantur.[14]

 Other versions of the legendarium 
As Vefantur, his wife was Fui Nienna and together they were called the ""Gods of Death"". Their halls were located beneath the roots of the Mountains of Valinor.[15]

Tulkas (Quenya; IPA: [ˈtulkas] - ""Strong"" or ""Steadfast"") was an Ainu; a Vala responsible for participating in war and the last of them to descend into Arda, coming to the aid of the others when he heard of their war with Melkor. He was also called Tulukastāz or Astaldo.

Contents[show]
 Biography 
Having heard of his fellow Valar's struggle against Melkor, Tulkas was the last of the Valar to descend upon Arda, thus tipping the scales of battle against Melkor. Melkor fled before him, and the Spring of Arda was begun.[2]
After the Two Lamps were erected and the Valar had made their first dwelling at Almaren, Tulkas wedded Nessa in a great feast. Being weary and content he slept, and Melkor decided his hour to retaliate had come.[3]
When the Children of Ilúvatar awoke, there was a council among the Valar regarding Melkor. Much to Tulkas's delight, it was decided that Melkor should be removed. During the War for Sake of the Elves, he wrestled with Melkor and bound him with Angainor, which was forged by Aulë.[4]
Upon Melkor's release from captivity, Tulkas remained vigilant and distrustful of him.[5]

 Character 
Tulkas is described as delighting in wrestling and contests of strength. He wields no weapon, and rides no steed. As he cares little about either past or future, he was not a good counselor, but nonetheless a very hardy friend. He is described as being slow to wrath, but also slow to forgive; for that reason, he was one of the Valar that opposed the release of Melkor.
In appearance, Tulkas was described to have ruddy flesh and golden hair and beard.[1]
He also tended to be impatient; before the Awakening of the Elves he urged the other Valar to wage war against Melkor. After the Darkening of Valinor he also hurried Fëanor to take a decision about surrendering the Silmarils.[1]
Tulkas was known for laughing in sport and in battle. He was possibly the only being on Arda with the courage to laugh in the face of Melkor, the most powerful being in Valinor (at the time) - and did so once while engaged in battle with him. Despite not being one of the Aratar, Morgoth feared Tulkas more than any of the other Valar.
He was also the strongest (physically) of all the Valar. Most likely, he was physically stronger than Morgoth, as it was he who first chained him with Angainor.

 Etymology 
In Quenya, the name Tulkas means ""Strong"" and ""Steadfast"", from the root tuluk.[6] His Valarin name is Tulukhastāz, which means ""the golden-haired"", from the words tulukha(n) (""yellow"") and (a)sata- (""hair of head"").[7] His Ñoldorin name was Tulcus (""strong"").[8]
Astaldo means ""the Valiant"".[9]

 Other names 
An earlier name for Tulkas was Turenbo.[10]

 Earlier versions of the legendarium 
In earlier texts (the Lost Tales), Melkor served in Tulkas' house when doing penitence for the Valar, following his ""three ages"" of imprisonment.[11] Melkor would escape after the destruction of the Two Trees. Many years later, after Tulkas overthrew Melkor in the battle of the Silent Pools, and bounds him to be kept within Lumbi. Here, the Hound of Mandos, Gorgumoth, guarded Melkor in his captivity.[12]
In an earlier context, Tulkas had a son Telimektar, ""whose tale is yet to tell"".[12]

Nienna (Quenya; IPA [niˈenna] or [niˈjenna] - ""Weeping"" or ""She Who Weeps"") was an Ainu, one of the Aratar and a Vala who was responsible for the mercy and grief spread across Arda. She was the sister of Mandos and Irmo and had no spouse. Her part in the Music of the Ainur was one of deep sadness, from which grief entered the world at its beginning.[1] She had dominion over the Halls of Nienna, which were on the western edge of Valinor, looking over the sea.

Contents[show]
 Biography 
    Nienna and the Masters of the Souls, by Jenny Dolfen  
Nienna was concerned with mourning, and she pitied the suffering of others, especially the Marring of Arda by Melkor.  Yet the lesson of Nienna is not of endless grief, but rather of pity, hope, and the endurance of the spirit.
Nienna dwelt in far western Valinor near Mandos, and she seldom came to Valimar. Her windows looked out beyond the Walls of the Night.[2]
During the creation of the Two Trees, she watered the mound with her tears.[3]
The pity of Nienna is most clearly seen in her support for Melkor when he sued for the pardon of the Valar. Though she spent her time in the world mourning for the destruction he had wreaked in Arda, when he sued for release after his three ages of Captivity, Nienna spoke on his behalf.[4]
After the Flight of the Ñoldor, Nienna mourned for the destruction of the Two Trees, and her tears brought healing, but could not heal the mortal wounds. Thus, the trees brought forth their last flower and fruit, and made into the Sun and Moon.[5]
Gandalf was Nienna's greatest pupil among all the others who dwelt in the Halls of Nienna. She taught him pity and many other things before he was chosen as the second wizard sent to lead the people of Middle-earth into standing against Sauron.[6]
All that is known about her appearance is that she wore a grey hood.[7] Given that Gandalf was her greatest student, his being clothed in grey may have been a mark of respect to his teacher. 

 Etymology 
Nienna means weeping or she who weeps in Quenya and comes from the root nei (""tear"").[8]

 Other versions of the legendarium 
In earlier writings, Nienna was the sister of Manwë and Melkor, and was called ""queen of shadow"".[9]
In The Book of Lost Tales Part One, a character similar to Nienna was called Fui (“night”), the Death-Goddess. In Gnomish she was Fuil, the Queen of the Dark. She dwelt in halls that bore her name, and had a roof of bats' wings. As Fui, she was the spouse of Vefantur (Mandos in Tolkien's later writings) and dwelt in his halls of Ve. She judged the humans while Vefantur judged the elves.[10]

    Nienna, the Compassionate  
Heskil (Winter One) and Núri (One who Sighs) were her names as well. She was additionally called Qalme-Tari (Mistress of Death).[11]

Estë (Quenya; IPA: [ˈeste]) was an Ainu and the Vala responsible for the healing of the hurt and weary.

Contents[show]
Biography
Estë lived with her husband in Lórien. She did not walk by day, but instead she slept upon an island of the tree-shadowed Lake of Lórellin in Lórien. And all those who dwelt in Valinor drew refreshment from the fountains of Estë and her spouse Irmo in Lórien. In like manner, to the gardens of Lórien, theValar themselves often came and would find easing and reposing there from the burdens of Arda.
Melian had formerly served both the Estë and Vána. In Lórien, Melian dwelt there long tending to the trees that flowered in the Gardens of Lórien before she departed for Middle-earth.[1]
After a time, when the Elves dwelt in Valinor, the King of the Ñoldor, Finwë, was grieved that his first wife had no more strength to carry on any longer. Afterwards, Manwë surrendered the care of Miriel to the spouse of Estë, Irmo in Lórien. Estë and her maidens still tended to the body of Miriel, and it remained unwithered, though Miriel never came back among the living.[2]
It was said that Estë did not attend the Councils of the Valar. Thus, she was not reckoned among the Valier and was counted instead as the Chief of the Maiar.[3]
She was dressed in grey.[4]

Etymology
Estë is a Quenya word that meant 'rest'.[4]

Vána (Quenya; IPA: [ˈvaːna] - ""Beautiful One"") was an Ainu and a Valië who was responsible for the preserving of the youth made for all life in Arda. Among the seven Valier, Vána was considered the sixth in terms of importance.[1] She was sister of Yavanna and wife of Orome, and was possibly related to Melian. She was also known as ""Vána the Ever-Young"". 

Contents[show]
Biography
Vána was the younger sister of Yavanna (Queen of the Earth) and the wife of Oromë (Huntsman of the Valar). In Vána's dwellings she had gardens filled with golden flowers; and often, Vána came to the forests of Oromë. Like her sister, the province of Vána was growing things of the world and she was a lover of nature. Vána had influence with the flora and fauna of Middle-earth, and she was associated especially with flowers thus Vána was also known as the ""Queen of Flowers"".[2]
It was said that when the Valar Tulkas and Nessa were wedded on the Isle of Almaren, the first dwelling of the Valar, Vána robed her sister-in-law Nessa the Swift (sister of Oromë) with her flowers.[3]
In the days of the Two Trees of Valinor, Arien of the Maiar, before she came to carry the vessel of the Sun, had served Vána by tending to the golden flowers of Vána's gardens, watering them with bright dews from golden tree Laurelin.[4] Melian also was another Maia who initially served Vána, before she departed for Middle-earth.[5]
After the Darkening of Valinor and the flight of the Noldor to Middle-Earth, most of the Valar were glad to have their ancient peace back, wishing neither the rumors of Melkor and his violence nor the murmur of the restless Noldor to come upon them again. Thus for such reasons, they clamored for the concealment of their land Aman. It was said that Vána was one among them.[6]

Character
According to The Silmarillion, ""All flowers spring as Vána passes and opens if she glances upon them; and all birds sing at her coming.""[1] Vána robed herself in flowers and it was said that her hair was golden in color.[7] Vána had the beauty of both heaven and earth upon her face and in all her works.[8] Like Nessa, Vána also sang and danced along with her maidens.[2]

The Maiar of Vána
Arien, the Maia who guided the Sun, was one of her Maiar in Valinor.
Melian, who later in Middle-earth became Queen of Doriath by marrying the Elf-King Thingol.

Etymology
The name Vána may have been derived from the Quenya word vanima (""beautiful""), as she is often described as ""fair"".[9] Hence she was also known as Vána the Fair.

 Trivia 
 Vána could possibly be related to Aragorn. Vána's sister Yavanna was said to be kin of Melian, and that could mean that Vána is also related to Melian, who is an ancestor of Aragorn. Her relation to Aragorn might also ensure her relation with other characters such as Luthien, Arwen, Elros, and Elrond.
 Her possible relation to Melian might be the reason Melian served her.
 Vána as a lover of nature, might also be a Vala of the Maia Aiwendil.

 Other versions of the legendarium 
Vána and her husband Oromë were once envisioned to have had a daughter named Nielíqui.[10]
In another material, Vána was the younger sister of Queen Varda and Yavanna.[2]
Vána played a formative role in the growth of great golden Tree Laurelin: 
""Then was the pit covered with rich earths that Palúrien (Yavanna) devised, and Vána came who loveth life and sunlight and at whose song the flowers arise and open, and the murmur of her maidens round her was like to the merry noise of the folk that stir abroad for the first time on a bright morning. There sang she the song of spring upon the mound, and danced about it, and watered it with great streams of that golden light that Ulmo (Lord of All Waters) had brought from the spilled lakes--as yet was Kulullin almost o'erflowing at that time.[10]
In earlier versions laid out in The History of Middle-earth, J.R.R. Tolkien wrote that when the great Two Trees of Valinor were destroyed, Vána fell into inconsolable grief for her great love for the golden Tree Laurelin. Furthermore, Vána then attempted to gather what she could of the spilled light in order to rekindle the dead Tree Laurelin. Yet, as Vána clung to the dead trunk of Laurelin after all ministrations had failed to rekindle the tree, her tears finally coaxed forth a new golden shoot that bore one golden fruit. The Valar used this golden fruit to construct the Sun that Vána's maiden Urwen (Arien) would later lead across the sky. Then Vána, in repentance of her earlier doubts, cut short her golden hair to weave the sails of the Sun-ship.[7]

Nessa (Quenya; IPA: [ˈnessa] - ""Young"") was an Ainu and a Valië and was ranked the least among the Valar. She was notable for her speed, being fast ""as an arrow in movement"", for which reason she was called Nessa the Swift.
Contents[show]
Biography
Nessa was the sister of Oromë. She was lithe and swift of foot and Nessa loved fast moving creatures such as deer. And the deer followed her train wherever she went even into the wild regions of Aman. Nessa could outrun the deer with great speed with the wind in her hair. Nessa married Tulkas aka Tulkas the Strong, during the Spring of Arda.[1]
Before the destruction of the Isle of Almaren, the first dwelling of the Valar, Nessa delighted in dancing and would often dance on the great green grass of Almaren; and later, in Valinor on never-fading green lawns.[1] Henceforth, as the Valar had finished with their labours in the creation of Arda, King Manwë ordained a great feast on Almaren. So the Valar were gathered upon Almaren during the Spring of Arda; and it was sung that on this great feast, Nessa wedded Tulkas there at that time where Nessa's sister-in-law, Vána the Ever-young, wife of Oromë, robed Nessa with her flowers.[2] Thereon, Nessa danced before the Valar upon the green grass of Almaren.[3]
The dwelling of Nessa and Tulkas was said to be a house full of mirth and revelry. For in the House of Tulkas, his warriors played and rivaled one another there in doughty feats. At times, Nessa would bear goblets of wine and cooling drinks among the champions of her husband.[4]
After the flight of the Ñoldor to Middle-earth, like most of the Valar, Nessa also desired ease and peace just like the ancient days of Valinor. Wishing not for the rumour of Melkor nor for the murmurs of the Ñoldor to come ever again among them and disturb their happiness. As a result for such reasons, most of the Valar clamored for the concealment of their land. Hence, the Hiding of Valinor took place.[5]

Etymology
Nessa comes from the Quenya neth (""young"").[6]

 Other names 
Two earlier names for Nessa were Helinyetille, the ""Eyes of Heartsease"", from helin (""violet, pansy""), and Melesta, from mele (""to love"").[7]

 Character 
Nessa loved most to retire to the fair ever-green lawns of Valinor which Oromë had cultivated from the richness of all his forest glades. For it was told that, when Yavanna (Queen of the Earth) created the forests of Oromë, she had planted there these forest glades with spells so that these glades would always remain green and smooth. There in the fair lawns of Valinor, Nessa along with her maidens would dance as long as the great golden Tree Laurelin was in bloom.[4] It was told that she herself was a greater dancer than Vána, for Nessa was not just known for her notable speed but for her dancing abilities as well.

 Other Versions in the Legendarium 
In the earlier texts, Nessa and Estë were considered ""highest among the Maiar"". Lea the Young was the wife of Tulkas, and was later changed to Nessa.
Nessa was once envisioned as the daughter of Vána.[8]

Tuor was an Adan of the House of Hador and a great hero of Men; the only son of Huor and Rían. He was the cousin of Túrin Turambar.

Contents[show]
Biography
Early life
Tuor was born in FA 472 after the Nirnaeth Arnoediad, in which his father Huor died. After hearing that the battle was lost, Rían fell into despair and left Dor-lómin while still pregnant with Tuor. She would have been lost and died if not for the Sindar Elves of Mithrim who rescued her and took her to their home in the Mountains of Mithrim. Tuor was soon born and first fostered by the Grey-elves. Later, their leader Annael told his mother Rían that Huor had perished in the battle. She soon fell into grief in her early twenties and went to Haudh-en-Ndengin, the Hill of the Slain and seeing the mounds of rotting and despoiled remains, she fell sick and died.
When the Easterlings came to claim their reward for aiding Morgoth in the Nirnaeth Arnoediad, they occupied Hithlum and captured its people as their slaves. The Sindar moved their camp into the caves of Androth and it was there that Tuor spent his youth. In his sixteenth year, he grew angry with the Easterlings and their allies for the evil deeds they had done to his people and wished to fight them. Annael forbid this and Tuor obeyed. When the Elven group intended to move to the safer havens in the Mouths of Sirion through the Gate of the Noldor, Tuor went with them but the group came under attack by Orcs and scattered during the night. Tuor was captured and sent to the Easterlings and sold into slavery.

A Thrall in Hithlum
Tuor served the Easterling chief, the brutal Lorgan, who had been sent there by Morgoth and who cruelly oppressed the remnant of the House of Hador. He worked as a thrall for three years, at which point he had grown to his full stature, and became taller and swifter than any of the Easterlings.

Wanderings
    Ulmo speaks with Tuor  
Tuor then escaped, and lived the life of an outlaw. He travelled down Hithlum to the Cirith Ninniach, and then through the Gate of the Noldor into Nevrast. At the Gate of the Ñoldor, he met two Noldorin Elves, Gelmir and Arminas, who showed him the way into Nevrast. He spent the rest of the year in Nevrast, until he saw seven swans, and took it as a sign that he had tarried too long. He followed these swans down the coast until he reached the ruins of Vinyamar, the previous home of Turgon and his people.
At this point, the Vala Ulmo, Lord of Waters, emerged from the Belegaer and appeared to Tuor, bestowing upon him a great cloak to shield him from the eyes of his enemies, and a quest to remind Turgon of the Doom of the Ñoldor, and to warn him of the Fall of Gondolin. He also found Voronwë, an Elf of Gondolin, who had been a mariner on the last Noldorin voyage to Valinor, saved from the wrath of Ossë.
Tuor and Voronwë then travelled through the Fell Winter past the Pools of Ivrin, where they caught a glimpse of Tuor's cousin, Turin, wielding Gurthang, and making his way towards the wastes of Dor-lomin.

 Life in Gondolin 
    Tuor's coming to Gondolin, by Ted Nasmith  
Passing through the Fell Winter, Tuor and Voronwë eventually arrived in Gondolin in FA 496. Upon arriving, he proclaimed to have been sent from Ulmo with a message to Turgon. Seeing Tuor arrayed in the devices of Ulmo, he was immediately taken to see the king, where he delivered Ulmo's warning to depart; that Morgoth was coming ever closer to discovering the location of Gondolin. However, Maeglin argued against Tuor and Turgon became conflicted. For he had grown to greatly love his city, which was by now as fair as Tirion itself, and he trusted still in it's secrecy and strength. As such, he did not evacuate as Ulmo advised. However, he did not wholly disregard the wisdom of Ulmo, and decreed that none should ever pass out of the Hidden City again. He ordered the passage through the Encircling Mountains to be sealed up, and as such Tuor was forced to remain in Gondolin, though he did so gladly. Tuor rose quickly in honor in the city, being of great stature both physically and spiritually and having had the privilege of conversing directly with Ulmo. Seven years after arriving in Gondolin, Tuor fell in love with King Turgon's Elven daughter, Idril Celebrindal, who loved him in return. Turgon, who already considered Tuor as close as kin, gave the couple his blessing. They were wed in a celebration of great happiness, and soon after, their only child Eärendil the Mariner was born, who himself became the father of Elrond and Elros.
As told in The Book of Lost Tales Part Two, the Elves in Gondolin treated Tuor very highly: ""Upon a time the king caused his most cunning artificers to fashion a suit of armour for Tuor as a great gift, and it was made of Ñoldorin steel overlaid with silver, but his helm was adorned with a device of metal and jewels like two swan-wings, one on either side, and a swan's wing was wrought on his shield"". ""A house was built for him upon the southern walls, for he loved the free airs and liked not the close neigborhood of other dwellings. There it was his delight often to stand on the battlements at dawn, and folk rejoiced to see the new light catch the wings of his helm.""[1]

    Tuor with the other Lords of Gondolin, by Kazuki Mendou  
Tuor was one of the leaders of Gondolin in the Fall of Gondolin, and fought for the city in the attack by the forces of Morgoth. He achieved meritorious deeds including forcing the the great Urulókë to retreat. He also stopped attack on his wife and son by Maeglin, which he was able to thwart by throwing him from the walls into a fire. Afterwards he, his wife, their son Eärendil, and a remnant of Gondolin's people escaped through a secret way in the mountains and traveled to the Mouths of Sirion. Longing for the sea, Tuor eventually built the ship Eärrámë and sailed into the West with Idril.
Despite his human state of mortality, the tradition of the Ñoldor was that when Tuor arrived with Idril in Valinor, bypassing the Ban of the Valar, he became the only Man to be accepted as one of the elder kindred, and thus shared with Beren and Lúthien, who were also granted a second life in Middle-earth, the exceptional fate of an immortal life in Valinor as long as Arda endured. Whether Eärendil ever found or saw his parents again is not known.[2][3]
In expanded account of him in The Book of Lost Tales, he and Idril reach the Tower of Pearl on one of the Enchanted Isles in the Shadowy Seas and either one or both fell asleep there for an unknown period of time.

Appearance
The only note of Tuor's physical appearance appears in Unfinished Tales: ""fair of face, and golden-haired after the manner of his father's kin, and he became tall and strong and valiant"".

Weapons
In The Book of Lost Tales Part Two (The History of Middle-earth, Vol. 2), it says, ""but he carried an axe rather than a sword, and this in the speech of the Gondolindrim he named Dramborleg, for its buffet stunned and its edge clove all armour.[1]

Idril, also called Celebrindal, was a Ñoldorin Elf of Gondolin. She was the daughter of Turgon and Elenwë, wife of the Man Tuor, and mother of Eärendil the Mariner, a Half-elven.

 Biography 
    Idril and her son Eärendil, by Egorit  
Idril Celebrindal was the only child of Turgon, whose wife Elenwë perished during the crossing of the Helcaraxë.[3] Together with Angrod's son Orodreth, she was one of the two Ñoldor in the third generation to come into exile. Idril was loved in secret by her cousin Maeglin, the son of Eöl the Dark Elf and Aredhel, Turgon's sister, but she scorned his advances because of his dark character, as well as the fact that they were too closely related.[4]
When Tuor, son of Huor, arrived in Gondolin, Idril fell in love with him. Because Turgon had grown to love Tuor as a son (as he had his father before), he allowed Idril and Tuor to wed, thus bringing about the second union of Men and Elves, after Beren and Lúthien.[4]
Being far-sighted she sensed danger and she encouraged Tuor to prepare a secret passage under the city so that if the city was attacked survivors could safely escape.[5] After the Fall of Gondolin, Idril and Tuor became leaders of the exiles at the Mouths of Sirion in the West Beleriand in the region of Arvernien, where they also received Elwing, daughter of Dior.
When Tuor grew old, he and Idril departed in his ship for the West. It is believed by the Elves and the Dúnedain that Idril and Tuor safely arrived in Valinor, bypassing the Ban of the Valar. Moreover, it was thought that Tuor was reckoned in the kindred of the Elves, and that both Idril and her husband thereafter dwelt in Valinor.[6][7]

    Idril Celebrindal, by Nebulosa Dreams  
 Etymology 
The name Idril is the Sindarin form of her Quenya name Itarillë (or Itarildë), which means ""sparkling brilliance"". Celebrindal is also a Sindarin word attached to her name which means ""silver-foot"",[8] due to the fact that she always walked in her barefeet.[9]

Turgon was a Ñoldorin Elf of Gondolin, second son of Fingolfin, brother of Fingon, Aredhel, Argon, and father of Idril. In Middle-earth, Turgon was the King of Gondolin and the High King of the Ñoldor. For centuries of the First Age, Turgon remained successfully hidden from Morgoth until a betrayal from within Gondolin brought its downfall.

 Biography 
    Turgon with his wife Elenwë before her death, by Filat  
In Eldamar Turgon was friendly with the sons of Finarfin, and opposed Fëanor's plan to pursue Morgoth after the theft of the Silmarils, but eventually he chose to follow them to Middle-earth and became one of the exiles. His wife Elenwë was lost crossing Helcaraxë,[2] but Turgon and his daughter Idril came to Nevrast, where he built Vinyamar and gathered to him one-third of the Ñoldor of Fingolfin and a large number of Sindar.[3]
In the year 50 of the First Age, Turgon was instructed by Ulmo to prepare a secret kingdom and was shown the hidden valley of Tumladen in the Encircling Mountains. After 52 years of secret labor, Turgon led his people into Gondolin, where he ruled for over 500 years, largely ignoring the events of the Wars of Beleriand.[4][5]
About two hundred years after Gondolin was wrought, Turgon's sister Aredhel journeyed to meet with the Sons of Fëanor. She was lost, however, and returned with her son Maeglin a few years later. After the deaths of both Eöl and Aredhel, Turgon took Maeglin under his wing and made him the Lord of the House of the Mole. Maeglin secretly loved Turgon's daughter Idril, who rejected his advances.[6]
Aside from the misadventure of Eöl, the splendor of Turgon's reign in Gondolin was undisturbed until Dagor Bragollach, when Turgon was brought his father's body by Thorondor. Two years later Thorondor brought him Húrin and Huor, whom he fostered for a year and then allowed to return to Dor-lómin. At this time, Turgon foresaw the doom of the Ñoldor, and he secretly sent mariners to try to obtain the mercy of the Valar.[7] None of these missions was successful and only one of the mariners, Voronwë, survived the Shadowy Seas paving the way for Tuor's coming to Gondolin.[8]
Turgon joined the Union of Maedhros with a ten thousand strong army and fought alongside his brother Fingon in the Nirnaeth Arnoediad, but the sacrifice of Húrin, Huor, and the Third House of the Edain enabled him to retreat without revealing the location of Gondolin.[9] When Tuor came to Gondolin in FA 496, Turgon welcomed him, but in his pride, he refused to follow the advice of Ulmo to flee to the Havens of Sirion. Now the full malice of Morgoth was directed toward Turgon, last of the House of Finwë to control a realm in Middle-earth. At last, aided by the treachery of Maeglin, Morgoth discovered the location of Gondolin, and Turgon was slain defending the city.[10]

 Etymology 
The first element tur of the name Turgon is a Sindarin word for ""power, mastery"".[11] His father-name was Turukáno, from túrë (""might, power"") and káno (""commander"").[12]

 Character 
As King of Gondolin, Turgon was described to be robed ""in white with a belt of gold, and a coronet of garnets was upon his head"".[13]
He was very much feared by Morgoth, and it is said in Valinor that Morgoth knew that from the House of Turgon would his ruin come. This holds true, as Turgon's grandson Eärendil was the one who indirectly caused his downfall, in the later War of Wrath.

""Evil have been all thy ways, son of Húrin. Thankless fosterling, outlaw, slayer of thy friend, thief of love, usurper of Nargothrond, captain foolhardy, and deserter of thy kin.""
—Glaurung's to Túrin[5]

Túrin Turambar was an Adan of the House of Hador and a Man of Middle-earth, who became a tragic hero (or anti-hero) of the First Age, in the tale called Narn i Chîn Húrin (""The Tale of the Children of Húrin"").

Contents[show]
 Biography 
 Early life 
Túrin was the only son of Húrin Thalion and Morwen Eledhwen. He had a younger sister Urwen, whom everyone called ""Lalaith"" because of her laughter. However, she died in childhood of plague. Túrin became a close friend of Sador the one-legged carpenter, whom he named Labadal (""hop-a-foot""). After Húrin was captured in the Nírnaeth Arnoediad, Túrin remained with his mother Morwen, who hid him from the Easterlings that Morgoth had sent to Hithlum, fearing they would kill Túrin or enslave him. Unknown to Túrin at that time, Morgoth had placed a curse on all of Húrin's family.

 Time in Doriath 
    Túrin in Doriath, by Filat  
When Túrin was eight years old, Morwen sent him to the Elven realm of Doriath, where he was adopted by Thingol as a son after meeting the Elf-maiden Nellas in the woods. After this, Túrin's second sister Nienor was born. Túrin was restless, and as soon as he was permitted he joined Beleg Cúthalion on the marches of Doriath, fighting the orcs of Morgoth. It was in this time he received the Dragon-helm of Dor-lómin from Thingol. In his early battles his helm protected him from many injuries, as he was inexperienced in warfare. The helm was an heirloom of the house of Hador and because of it the orcs feared him above all others. 

 Life as an outlaw 
Túrin accidentally caused the death of Saeros, one of Thingol's counselors who provoked and attacked him. Before he could be either punished or forgiven, he fled, eventually encountering a band of outlaws that dwelt south of Brethil. There he identified himself only as Neithan (the wronged). The men of the band realised he was by far the most skilled of the group so they spoke not out against him. After seeing him terrorize an innocent woman, Túrin killed their leader, and became their leader in his place. During his rule, he stopped the outlaws from raiding houses of free folk, and only hunted Orcs. 
In the meantime, Beleg Cúthalion obtained leave by Thingol to seek out his friend. In FA 487, Beleg found Túrin's outlaws at the outskirts of Amon Rûdh and was held tied up in question by them until Túrin returned. Androg, who was a prominent member of the group, mistrusted Beleg even after Túrin declared him a friend and begrudged him Túrin`s friendship. Beleg tried to persuade Túrin to return to Doriath, for the king held that he was innocent. When Beleg could not persuade his friend to leave the outlaws, he left to return to Doriath. Túrin's band later captured Mîm the Petty-dwarf while Beleg and Túrin were parted. Mîm was forced to share his halls on Amon Rûdh with his company while Túrin promised to repay Mîm for the accidental death of his son Khîm. 

 Death of Beleg 
At Doriath, Beleg asked to be able to join his friend. Thingol allowed this and also gave him the sword Anglachel, and Thingol's wife Melian gave him Lembas. Beleg returned to Túrin that winter, healing those of the band that had become sick with cold. Beleg brought with him the Dragon-helm, after Turin agreed to take the Dragon-helm, the area around Amon Rûdh became known as Dor-Cúarthol, ""The Land of Bow and Helm"" (since Beleg was known as a mighty bowman). There Túrin took the name Gorthol, ""The Dread Helm"". Many warriors joined them, and much of the West of Beleriand was freed from evil for a while. Mîm, however, was greatly jealous of Beleg's friendship with Túrin.
Eventually, Túrin was betrayed by Mîm the dwarf. He allowed a pack of Orcs to have information with which they could destroy the company, as long as he was allowed to kill Beleg himself. Túrin was captured at the top of Amon Rûdh and all his men were slain about him. Beleg was saved by Androg who killed Mím with his last action before dying. Beleg then rescued Túrin from the orcs in Taur-nu-Fuin with the help of Gwindor, an escaped slave of Morgoth, but Túrin accidentally killed Beleg with the sword Anglachel, for Beleg, who was trying to cut Túrin's bonds, was mistaken by Túrin as one of the orcs tormenting him. Gwindor and Túrin then fled the others, and as Túrin's mind was lost in a silent sadness, Gwindor led him to the Pools of Ivrin, where Túrin then cried and his madness was cured.

 Leader of Nargothrond 
    The Dragon of Dor-lomin  
Gwindor then led Túrin to Nargothrond, where once he had lived. In Nargothrond, Túrin hid his name, calling himself by the alias Agarwaen son of Úmarth (Sindarin for ""Bloodstained son of Ill-fate""), while hoping to hide his identity and escape Morgoth's curse upon his kin. He had Anglachel reforged and named it Gurthang, ""Iron of Death"". Finduilas, daughter of Orodreth, fell in love with him, but he avoided her because she had previously been the beloved of his friend Gwindor. Túrin declined to tell her his name, so that she called him Thurin (the secret). He was also called Adanedhel (Man-Elf) because he was so like an elf, though he was human. Gwindor later revealed Túrin's true identity to Finduilas when anger and sadness over took him and it eventually reached Finduilas' father, King Orodreth.
The revelation of his identity resulted in Túrin becoming a chief counsellor of Orodreth, and was extremely influential in Nargothrond. He encouraged the Nargothrondrim to abandon their practice of secrecy, and they built a great bridge before the gates. Because of his prowess with Gurthang, he himself became known as the Mormegil (Black Sword), or the Black Sword of Nargothrond. In FA 495, with Orodreth now deep in the council of Túrin, the Elves of Nargothrond marched out from their secret city with an army of some thousands of elves to confront the enemy massing beneath the Ered Wethrin (Mountains of Shadow) and in the Pass of Sirion. They were overwhelmed and driven into the Plain of Tumhalad and utterly defeated in the Battle of Tumhalad. Only Túrin, who wore the Dragon Helm of Dor-lómin was able to survive the hot fiery blasts of Glaurung and escaped. There was a desperate attempt to destroy the bridge Túrin has ordered to be built for swifter actions of the army, alas it was too well made and the enemy arrived and Glaurung the father of dragons destroyed the gate and the sacking of the once mighty Nargothrond, began.

 The Dragon's Deceit 
    Túrin and Níniel in Brethil, by Gustavo Malek  
Túrin was caught by the powerful gaze of Glaurung at the smashed gate of the city, and stood by idly as Finduilas and hundreds of captives was dragged away, Finduilas called to him, once her cries were drowned out in the distance Túrin was released from Glaurung's spell of which deceived Túrin into believing Morwen and Nienor were suffering in Dor-lómin, and Túrin abandoned Finduilas to seek out his kin. In actuality, Morwen and Nienor were safely in Doriath, as Túrin's own efforts had made the way passable.
Once in Dor-lómin, Túrin found his old home empty. He went to the halls of the Easterling lord Brodda, who had taken Húrin's kinswoman Aerin as a wife and many a time beaten her and enslaved Túrin's people, Brodda had also taken Húrin's lands and possessions to which also rightfully belonged to Túrin. From Aerin, Túrin learned that Morwen had left, and in his rage, he held Brodda up like a dog and threw him in a group of men, breaking Brodda’s neck and killing him, thereby also sealing Aerin's fate. As Túrin left again, Aerin burnt herself alive in Brodda's halls, and the remainder of the House of Hador now was persecuted even more cruelly. There he also met Sador once again before he died. Adding to the list of people whose lives his rash actions had ended.
Túrin next tried to find Finduilas, but by the time he picked up the Orcs' trail he came too late: the woodsmen of Brethil informed him she had been killed as they had tried to rescue the prisoners of Nargothrond. Túrin collapsed on the mound she was buried in, and was brought to Brethil.
In Brethil Túrin again took up his life, now calling himself Turambar (Master of Doom) in an act of bravado, deciding that his curse was now finally over. One night in the middle of a fierce storm he and his men found a naked young woman on Finduilas's grave, and called her Níniel ""Maiden of tears"" due to her crying, for she knew nothing. Túrin years later took her as his wife. Túrin did not know that this was indeed his sister, whose memory had been erased by Glaurung. Brandir, out of jealousy or forecast, told Niniel that a shadow was cast above Túrin, and that instead of being Master of Shadow, the Shadow would inevitably master him.

 Slayer of Glaurung 
    Glaurung's death  
Túrin's happiness ended when Glaurung came near Brethil, burning miles and miles of forest so that he could reach where the woodsmen lived. Túrin with two others set out to kill the dragon, but he was the only one to reach the drake. Dorlas, being too cowardly, abandoned Túrin, but Hunthor the faithful went on. As Túrin passed underneath the dragon, he nearly toppled into the waters due to the dragon's stench had it not been for Hunthor, who steadied him. Unfortunately, as a result of this action, a stone moved by Glaurang's passing hit Hunthor on the head, and he fell into the ravine. With his black sword and bitterness in his heart, Túrin then stabbed the dragon's belly with all his hatred and power; killing Glaurung at Cabed-en-Aras, but as he retrieved his sword the foul blood of the Dragon fell on his hand and he was hurt and fell in a swoon. As Níniel came to search for him, Glaurung with his last words revealed to her that she was Turin's sister. Horrified, and believing Túrin dead, Nienor Níniel killed herself by leaping into the ravines of the river.

 Death 
    Níniel finds Túrin after the slaying of Glaurung, thinking he is dead, by Vigshane  
When Túrin awoke he was told by Brandir the Lame, lord of the Haladin of Brethil what had happened. In anger, he killed Brandir in front of many people, refusing to believe the truth. When he learned from Mablung of Doriath, who had come to seek him, that Brandir was telling truth and that he had wrongfully slain him, Túrin could no longer live with the pains and misfortunes of his life and determined to commit suicide. Just before his death, he revealed that he had been 'blind'; Morgoth's curse had had him groping in the dark since childhood.  
Then, Turin said to Gurthang: ""Hail Gurthang, iron of death, thou alone now remainest! But what lord or loyalty dost thou know, save the hand that wieldeth thee? From no blood wilt thou shrink! Wilt thou take Tùrin Turambar? Wilt thou slay me swiftly?""

    Turin kneeling at Cabed Naeramarth, in dialogue with his sword  
And from the blade rang a cold voice in answer: ""Yea, I will drink thy blood, that may I forget the blood of Beleg my master, and the blood of Brandir slain unjustly. I will slay thee swiftly."" Then Tùrin set the hilts upon the ground, and cast himself upon the point of Gurthang, and the black blade took his life. Túrin and several of the others connected to his story are some of the few people in the Middle-earth legendarium to have committed suicide.
An alternate interpretation of Túrin's revelation mirrors that of his father's in the Silmarillion, that all that he had seen was twisted by the malice and might of Morgoth, and so as if blind, he stumbled through life.
Túrin was buried near Finduilas' grave, in a high mound where he had fallen, and the shards of Gurthang were set beside him.


'And thereon the Elves carved in the Runes of Doriath:
TÚRIN TURAMBAR DAGNIR GLAURUNGA
(Túrin, Master of Fate, Slayer of Glaurung).
and beneath they wrote also:
NIËNOR NÍNIEL


 Aftermath 
After Húrin, Túrin's father, was released from Angband, he and his wife Morwen met at the gravesite of their children for the first and last time, and Morwen died when the sun set holding Húrin's hand and was also buried there. The mound they were buried beneath survived the War of Wrath and Tol Morwen was the westernmost isle off the coast of Lindon in the Second and Third Ages.[6]
Whether the tragedies in Túrin's life were the result of Morgoth's curse or of his own arrogance, or some combination of the two, are a subject of some debate among fans and scholars.

 Legacy 
The second prophecy of Mandos (later removed from The Silmarillion by Christopher Tolkien) states that at the End of Time Morgoth would wage a final battle against the Valar, the Final Battle, and that Túrin Turambar reincarnated would plunge Gurthang into Morgoth's heart and defeat him once and for all, exterminating evil forever, and avenging the Children of Húrin.
The supposed resemblance of Túrin to figures from medieval tales can be confirmed by part of a letter Tolkien wrote to Milton Waldman, a publisher, concerning the publication of his works.[7][8]

 Etymology 
The name Túrin means ""he who desires mastery"", from the Sindarin words tûr (""power, mastery, lord"") and ind (desire, heart""). In Quenya, his name becomes Turindo, from tur (""master"") and indo (""mood"").[9]
Turambar means ""Master of Doom"", from the Quenya tur (""master"") and ambar (""doom"").[10]

Rían was an Edain woman of the House of Bëor and the wife of Huor and mother of Tuor.

Contents[show]
 Biography 
Rían was the daughter of Belegund and the cousin of Morwen and was born around 450 of the First Age in probably in Ladros, Dorthonion. Rían was a gentle hearted woman and was a lover of nature, especially trees and flowers, and loved neither hunting nor war. She was also a singer and composed songs. She was only a young child during the Dagor Bragollach in FA 455, when Belegund became a companion of Barahir. Then, she was led to safety with the other women and children with Emeldir, the mother of Beren to Dor-lómin where the House of Hador dwelt. Rían's father died in FA 461.[2]
Around FA 470, when Rían was twenty, she wedded Huor of the House of Marach, whose brother Húrin was married to Rían's cousin Morwen. They were married only two months for Huor joined the armies of the Edain in the Nirnaeth Arnoediad and was slain in combat with a poison arrow. Soon after that, Rían gave birth to a son, Tuor and during the winter months she entrusted him to Annael of the Sindar living in the hills Mithrim for fosterage.[3][4] Afterwards, she went to the Haudh-en-Nirnaeth sometime later in FA 473 and fell into grief and despair upon seeing the horror of the losses of the battle where her husband was killed, and then laid herself on the mound and died. She was only twenty-three years old.[5][6][4][7]

 Etymology 
Rían was a Sindarin word.[8] The name Rían is thought to have meant ""crowned gift"", originating from the words rî, meaning ""crown"", and ann, meaning ""gift"". The ending 'an' could also have come from the word anna, meaning ""give"", which is also found in Sindarin.

Voronwë, also called Aranwion, was a Ñoldorin Elf mariner from Gondolin who was one of a crew of several ships sent by Turgon to solicit aid from the Valar. The Doom of Mandos, however, made any such attempt futile, and Voronwë was the only one to survive.[2]

 Biography 
    Voronwë sitting by the sea after the foundering of his ship, by Filat  
Voronwë was relatively young according to the measure of the Elves, having been born in Middle-earth (and specifically in Nevrast) instead of Valinor. His father was Aranwë, a Ñoldo, but his mother was of the Sindarin Elves of the Falas, and kinswoman of Círdan. He called himself ""of the House of Fingolfin"", which in this case means a follower of that house, rather than a relationship of blood.
Voronwë was saved by Ulmo with the express purpose of leading Tuor to Gondolin, which he did.[3]
During the Fall of Gondolin, Voronwë was asked by Tuor to guard Idril. He escaped the sack, following Tuor and Idril in the secret way. He led them until Sirion and they did not continue, for Voronwë did not know the regions beyond the river.[4]
It was said that Voronwë sailed west with Eärendil in Vingilot.[5]

 Etymology 
His name is Quenya in origin. Voronwë means ""steadfast""[6] and his surname Aranwion means ""son of Aranwë"". The name Voronwë also appears as an epessë (honourary title) of various other characters, for example Mardil Voronwë.
He called himself Bronweg, the Sindarin version of his name.[7] It also means ""steadfast"".[6]

Ñoldor (House of Finarfin)Falmari (House of Olwë)Elves of Nargothrond



Orodreth was a Ñoldorin Elf of the First Age who was the second ruler of the underground city of Nargothrond in western Beleriand. He was born to a Noldorin father, Finarfin, and a Telerin mother, Eärwen, in the city of Tirion during the Years of the Trees and was the brother of Finrod Felagund, Angrod, Aegnor and Galadriel. Orodreth had an only child and daughter Finduilas with an unnamed wife. He was later killed in the Battle of Tumhalad.
However, according to later notes of Tolkien's, Orodreth was the son of Finarfin's son Angrod and Eldalótë. Hence, this made Orodreth the grandson of Finarfin and Eärwen since he was Angrod's son, and he became the nephew of Finrod, Aegnor, and Galadriel. Orodreth's wife was a Sindarin lady of the North, and they had two children: Finduilas and Gil-galad.[2]

Contents[show]
 Biography 
Through his grandmother (mother) Eärwen of the Falmari (Teleri of Aman), he shared the blood of both the Ñoldor (House of Finarfin) and that of the Falmari (House of Olwë).[3] After the Doom of Mandos was announced in Araman, he and the rest of the Ñoldor left for Middle-earth. Even as his grandfather (father) Finarfin and many of his House turned back to Valinor, Orodreth stayed with his uncle Fingolfin and his host and pursued his journey to Middle-earth.[4]
Orodreth once held the isle of Minas Tirith in the vale of Sirion[5] until Sauron overran the isle and turned it into Tol-in-Gaurhoth. Orodreth then fled south to Nargothrond.[6]
When Beren came to the Kingdom of Nargothrond, King Finrod went with him on his quest for the Silmaril. However, Celegorm and Curufin, the Sons of Fëanor, were also at Nargothrond, and forced Finrod to lay down his crown. Orodreth took it, ruling as regent, but the Sons of Fëanor held the real power. When news came that Finrod had been killed, the Sons of Fëanor were expelled from Nargothrond and Orodreth became its next king.[7]
When Túrin Turambar arrived in Nargothrond he gradually became its leader and Orodreth held no actual power, even if he was still King in name. High in Orodreth's councils, Túrin convinced him to build the Bridge of Nargothrond and abandon their secretive method of warfare in favor of open warfare.[8] In FA 495, Orodreth and Túrin marched out to meet the hosts of Morgoth and the Dragon Glaurung at Tumhalad and Orodreth died fighting there, and his realm was subsequently conquered.[9][10]

 Etymology 
The name Orodreth is Sindarin for ""mountaineer"", which came from the word orod (""mountain"").[11][12]
His name in Quenya was Artaresto, which appears to have come from the word arta (""fortress, high"") and resto, which have originated from the word retta (""climber"").[13]
Interestingly, if the second part of his Quenyan name did come from retta, it is easily concievable that the second component of his Quenyan name resto was converted into reth when translated into Sindarin, hence ""mountaineer"", or more literally in this case, ""mountain climber"".

Glaurung was the first terrestrial, fire-breathing Dragon in Middle-earth. He was known as the Father of Dragons.

Contents[show]
 Biography 
 Early years 
After suffering a number of defeats at the hands of the Ñoldor in Beleriand, Morgoth came to realize that his armies of Orcs were no match for the Noldor unaided. As such, he began to experiment with ways to create new, deadlier creatures for use in his armies. Glaurung was the result of these experiments. After a century of brooding and growing in the dark pits of Angband, Glaurung first emerged in FA 260 and attacked the Elves maintaining the Siege of Angband. Though Glaurung was not of the winged race that would later arise, he was the greatest terror of his time. He burned and ravaged Ard-galen, the land of the Elves in Hithlum and Dorthonion. However, he was not yet at his full strength, so was driven back by Fingon, the prince of Hithlum at that time, and his archers. Morgoth was displeased with Glaurung for revealing himself before he had grown to full strength, but this did not greatly disrupt Morgoth's plans. 

 War upon the Elves 
 Dagor Bragollach 
    Glaurung, the black worm, by Vaejoun  
Glaurung was contained in Angband for another two centuries before he was again loosed during the Fourth Battle of the Battles of Beleriand. Known as the Dagor Bragollach for the fires unleashed by Morgoth from the Iron Mountains, Glaurung in full power led Melkor's forces against the High Elves of Beleriand. Now fully grown, none could withstand his might, and with the Balrogs at his side, Glaurung led the Orcs to an overwhelming victory and broke the siege of Angband.

 Nirnaeth Arnoediad 
    Glaurung with dark forces by Ralphdamiani  
In the fifth battle, the Nirnaeth Arnoediad, Glaurung caused even more destruction, as he had fathered a brood of lesser Dragons to follow him into battle. So a great army of Elves and Men fell before the onslaught, for none could withstand the Dragonfire save the Dwarves of Belegost, who had come to battle a common foe.
After the Elven and Edain armies had been broken, Morgoth used Glaurung to hold the territories he gained; but force in battle was not the only power the monster knew. He brought many under his sway with the binding power of his serpent eye and hypnotic Dragon Spell.

 The Sack of Nargothrond 
    Túrin and Glaurung, by Woutart  
After Glaurung aided Morgoth during the Battle of Unnumbered Tears, he was given the assignment to complete the Sack of Nargothrond, one of the Elven fortresses in Beleriand. Glaurung came upon Nargothrond with great force, and sacked the kingdom easily. He faced Túrin, son of Húrin, at the gate and so he froze him with his eyes. Túrin heard the screams of Finduilas, daughter of Orodreth, as he stood there. When the captives had been taken away, Túrin was released from Glaurung's spell and gave him two choices: to follow Finduilas or to aid his mother and sister, who were suffering in Dor-lómin. Túrin chose the latter, and in this way he was deceived by the dragon, for his mother and sister were living well in Doriath. Glaurung then gathered up all the treasures of Felagund and hoarded them deep within Nargothrond, and rested there, guarding them.

 Last years 
    Glaurung meeting Nienor  
Glaurung received knowledge of Morwen and Nienor's departure to seek their family members. In the forest where they traveled, Glaurung found Nienor and caused her to lose her mind. She was driven to run through the forest ""like a deer"". Soon after this, Túrin found her crying on Finduilas's grave. Not knowing that she was his sister, Túrin named her Níniel ('tear maiden') and took her to his home with the folk of Brandir. There they lived for three years, during which they fell in love.

 Death 
    Turin aiming for Glaurung, by Francesc Camos  
After those years, Glaurung attacked the area around their home. Túrin resolved to kill the dragon. Two men went with him. One became afraid and fled, and the other was crushed by rocks. However, Túrin was able to kill Glaurung by thrusting his sword, Gurthang, into Glaurung's belly. Glaurung felt his death wound and screamed. When the dragon's blood touched Túrin, he fell into a swoon. Glaurung screamed until his strength was gone. Nienor found him there, with Túrin beside him. With his last breath, Glaurung gave Nienor her memory back, and died. Shortly thereafter, Nienor jumped into the river below, and Túrin awoke and threw himself on his sword.[2][3][4]

 Earlier stages 
In J.R.R. Tolkien's Lost Tales, Glorund was the original name of Glaurung.

 Parallel 
Túrin's killing of Glaurung greatly resembles the killing of the dragon Fafnir by Siegfried (or Sigurd) in German Mythology, who, knowing Fafnir's scales were impenetrable, dug a hole and waited for Fafnir to pass over it, allowing Siegfried to stab his dragon's vulnerable belly. Also like Glaurung, Fafnir's last words were a message to poison Siegfried's trust in the ones he loved.

Ñoldor (House of Fingolfin)



Fingon the ""Valiant"" was an Ñoldorin Elf, the eldest son of Fingolfin, and older brother of Turgon, Aredhel, and Argon.[1]
He was High King of the Ñoldor in Middle-earth during the First Age after the death of his father. He was instrumental in healing the rift between the Sons of Fëanor and the followers of his father after their desertion of them in Araman.

 Biography 
    The Children of Fingolfin, by niyochara  
Fingon was born in Aman, probably in Tirion where the House of Finwë was located. When the Ñoldor were resolved to return to Middle-earth, Fingon followed his father and his people, though they were drawn more to the ruling of their own realms and adventurism rather than vengeance and the recovery of the Silmarils, as Fëanor and his sons sought. He fought in the first Kinslaying but only because he, seeing Elf fighting Elf, believed that the Teleri had been told to prevent the Ñoldor from leaving Aman by force by the Valar.[2]
After Fëanor's abandonment of them, Fingon and his people were led by Fingolfin across the perilous Helcaraxë. They arrived in Middle-earth at the beginning of the First Age, and the Noldor witnessed the rising of the Sun.

    Fingon saves Maedhros from Thangorodrim  
After the Dagor-nuin-Giliath and the death of Fëanor, Maedhros, Fingon's cousin and friend, was taken and hung by the wrist upon Thangorodrim. Fingon marched to Thangorodrim and with the help of Thorondor, Lord of the Eagles, found Maedhros. Maedhros begged Fingon to kill him, but Fingon instead severed Maedhros's hand by the wrist, and brought him back to the Noldorin camp. It was this act of bravery and compassion that resolved the dispute as to whose house would rule over the Ñoldor in Middle-earth, for Maedhros renounced his claim to the High Kingship of the Ñoldor, instead ceding it to House of Fingolfin.[3]
Fingolfin gave him a domain in Dor-lómin, in the west of Hithlum, where he did good service during the Siege of Angband, defeating an Orc army that attempted to go around to the north and attack Hithlum from the west, and then later the first to fight against the dragon Glaurung when he first came forth from Angband during the Dagor Aglareb.[3]
Fingon became High King when Fingolfin died dueling with Morgoth after the Dagor Bragollach. Seven years later, Morgoth's forces invaded Hithlum, and Fingon was hard-pressed and outnumbered, but Círdan and the people of the Falas, who came up the Firth of Drengist rescued them in their ships.[note 1][4]

    The Death of Fingon, by Jenny Dolfen  
Fingon's final battle was the Nirnaeth Arnoediad. Fingon led the attack on Angband, and the fury of his warriors nearly won the day. Unfortunately, due to Ulfang's treachery, Maedhros did not arrive until three days after he was expected. This resulted in Morgoth releasing his Balrogs and Glaurung the dragon on the already weakened Ñoldor force. When Maedhros finally arrived, hope was reborn for Fingon's army; however, Ulfang's treachery again took effect, causing Maedhros to withdraw. Fingon was then surrounded and his guards killed. He dueled Gothmog, lord of Balrogs, but was struck from behind by another. Gothmog then clove Fingon's helm, and fire sprang from it. This presumably killed Fingon instantly, but the Balrogs proceeded to beat his body into the dust long after he was dead. Thus the day ended in defeat for the elves.[5]
His younger brother Turgon became the next rightful High King of the Ñoldor, even though his host retreated after the battle and remained secretly in Gondolin.[6]

Character
Fingon was described as follows: ""His valour was as a fire yet steadfast as the hills of stone; wise he was and skilled in voice and hand; troth and justice he loved and bore goodwill to all, both Elves and Men, hating Morgoth only; he sought not his own, neither power nor glory, and death was his reward.""[7]
The only note of Fingon's physical appearance describes that Fingon ""wore his long dark hair in great plaits braided with gold"".[8]

Etymology
Fingon is the Sindarin version of his Quenyan father-name Findekáno.[8] The exact origin of  Findekáno is unclear, but it may derive from the words findë (""hair"") or phin (""skill""), and kane (""valour"")[9] or káno (""commander, lesser chief"").[8]
The name Findekáno could mean either ""cunning commander"", or rather unusually, ""hair commander"". In Sindarin, fin translates to ""hair"".[10]

Ñoldor (House of Finwë)



Fingolfin was the second High King of the Ñoldor in Beleriand; the Ñoldor being one of the three branches of Elves. He was the eldest son of Finwë and Indis, younger brother of Findis, older brother of Irimë and Finarfin, and the younger half-brother of Fëanor. He founded the House of Fingolfin, which ruled the Ñoldor in Middle-earth. His wife was Anairë and his children were Fingon, Turgon, Aredhel, and Argon. Fingolfin was said to be the strongest, most steadfast, and most valiant of Finwë's sons.[3]
He had a steed named Rochallor.

 Biography 
 Life in Valinor 
    ""Get thee gone, and take thy due place!"", by Jenny Dolfen  
Fingolfin was born in Tirion in Valinor during the Noontide of Valinor. Neither he nor his brothers were particularly close to Fëanor, as he was rather scornful of them. Nonetheless, he lived in peace with his kin for many centuries. However, the peace of Valinor was brought to an end when Melkor, the most powerful of the Valar and the source of evil in Arda, was released from imprisonment. Feigning repentance and rehabilitation, Melkor's malice had in fact only festered and grown worse while imprisoned, and he sought to bring ruin upon the Elves for, as he saw it, causing his downfall. Of the three clans of Elves in Aman, only the Ñoldor welcomed him, as his knowledge was the greatest of any of the Valar. Gaining their confidence, Melkor was slowly able to spread lies and half-truths amongst them regarding the intentions of the Valar. Over time, these lies bore fruit and the Ñoldor began to openly debate remaining in Aman, and chief among the disgruntled Elves was Fëanor. One of the lies was that the sons of Indis, of which Fingolfin was the eldest, were trying to usurp Fëanor as the rightful heir of Finwë and seize the Silmarils, three magnificently beautiful gems that Fëanor had created, for themselves.
Fëanor, already not fond of his half-siblings, had little trouble believing the rumor. Fëanor hastened to Tirion and confronted Fingolfin, drawing his sword and threatening him with violence. When it became known what Fëanor had done to Fingolfin, he was called by the Valar to explain himself, and Melkor's lies were found out. However, Fëanor was held accountable for threatening Fingolfin and was banished to the fortress of Formenos in the north.[4] Around twelve years later, the two brothers reconciled at a festival in Valinor (though Fëanor did so only grudgingly). However, during this festival, Melkor and the monstrous spider Ungoliant attacked, killing the Two Trees of Valinor and darkening all of Aman. They then assaulted the fortress of Formenos, where Melkor slew Finwë and stole Fëanor's Silmarils. In his pride, grief, anger, and selfishness, Fëanor sought revenge upon Melkor (now named Morgoth), and attempted to convince the rest of the Ñoldor to assist him by convincing them that journeying to Middle-earth would bring them glories and treasures untold. However, many were either not convinced or only half convinced, and deferred to Fingolfin, who was more trusted than his brother. Fingolfin, though not particularly keen to leave Valinor, had sworn to Fëanor to uphold his place as the elder brother, and did not want to abandon his people to the decisions of his rash and selfish brother. He decided to accompany Fëanor.[5]

 Life in Middle-earth 
    Fingolfin Leads the Host Across the Helcaraxë, by Ted Nasmith  
As such, Fingolfin ended up becoming the leader of the second and largest of the three Ñoldor hosts to leave Tirion for Middle-earth. Fëanor led the first, and Fingolfin's brother Finarfin led the third, smallest, and most reluctant host. Most of those who journeyed with him were somewhat reluctant to leave, and so it took a longer time for them to start their journey than the host directly following Fëanor. Unfortunately, this delay caused Fingolfin to make a grievous mistake, for not long after setting out, Fëanor attempted to seize the fleet of the seafaring Teleri Elves in order to get to Middle-earth more quickly and safely. The Teleri resisted fiercely, and Fingolfin's host caught up with Fëanor's during the middle of a heated battle. Seeing this, Fingolfin mistakenly assumed that the Teleri had attempted to waylay the Ñoldor, perhaps even at the request of the Valar. He and his host joined the battle against the Teleri, and completed the first Elven kinslaying. After the slaughter and the theft of the ships, the Ñoldor encountered a figure, possibly Mandos himself, who proclaimed a terrible Doom upon them for the Kinslaying. Hearing this, and having not participated at all in the slaughter of the Teleri, Finarfin's host turned back and returned to Tirion. The rest of the Ñoldor continued north, but as the journey grew more and more dangerous, many of the Ñoldor, upset about the Kinslaying and having been reluctant in the first place, began to openly curse Fëanor. In response, he and those most loyal to him departed one night on the Teleri ships. Upon reaching Middle-earth, Fëanor burned the ships. The fires were spotted by Fingolfin's host, and they knew that they were betrayed. Fingolfin's host's only route to Middle-earth was now to cross the phenomenally dangerous ices of the Helcaraxë or to return to Tirion in disgrace and suffer the punishment of the Valar for their role in the Kinslaying. But Fingolfin wished to continue to Middle-earth, in no small part to confront the brother for his utter betrayal. Fingolfin's host chose to cross the Helcaraxë, but lost many of its members along the way, greatly increasing the wrath and bitterness that Fingolfin and his host felt for Fëanor's host. The host of Fingolfin finally arrived in Middle-earth at the rising of the Sun (FA 1) and was assailed by an Orc army in Lammoth resulting in the death of Fingolfin's youngest child. Destroying the Orc host, Fingolfin and his army approached the doors of Angband, Morgoth's great fortress and smote upon them, but Morgoth and his servants, dismayed by the light of the new Sun, stayed hidden inside. Fingolfin and the Ñoldor then came to the northern shores of Lake Mithrim (FA 2), from which the Fëanorian part of the host had withdrawn. 
With virtually all of Fingolfin's host furious over Fëanor's betrayal, a civil war would have broken out amongst the Ñoldor had it not been for the actions of Fingolfin's son Fingon. After the initial confrontation of Fëanor's host against Morgoth's forces, the Elves had defeated their foes with relative ease, but Fëanor in his pride and wrath had thought to come upon Morgoth himself, and had pursued the remnants of Morgoth's army with only a small vanguard. Upon reaching Angband, this vanguard encountered a few Balrogs and had quickly been slain, with Fëanor falling at the hands of Gothmog, Lord of the Balrogs. After this, Morgoth had sent a false claim of parley to the new leader of Fëanor's host; his eldest son Maedhros. Expecting treachery, both sides sent greater force than agreed upon to the negotiation site, but Morgoth's had been accompanied by Balrogs, who slew the Elven company in short order and captured Maedhros. After failing to gain concessions from the Elves by offering to release Maedhros, Morgoth chained Maedrhos to a cliff by one hand and left him there. Fingon quickly learned of this and, having been a great friend of Maedhros before Fëanor's divisive actions, he sought to rescue his friend. Succeeding, both returned to the gathered Ñoldor, who were amazed at Fingon's actions. Seeking to keep his people united, Maedhros waived all claim to kingship, and Fingolfin thus became High King of the Ñoldor (FA 7). They were quickly able to establish mighty kingdoms in Beleriand, and subsequent attacks by Morgoth against them were repelled completely and with relative ease. Fingolfin established the Siege of Angband after the complete victory of Dagor Aglareb, and ruled in peace and prosperity from Hithlum, by the northern shores of Lake Mithrim. On FA 20, he hosted the famous feast of Mereth Aderthad in Eithel Ivrin, which was attended by emissaries from all the Elves in Beleriand.[6] There Fingolfin retained close counsel and friendship with Maedhros.

    The duel of Fingolfin and Morgoth  
 Combat with Morgoth and death 
Though the Elves were able to contain Morgoth's Orcs, they did not possess the strength to attack Angband directly or actually overthrow Morgoth. Morgoth himself was not idle during the four hundred years of the siege, and he spent the time increasing the strength of his forces and creating new, deadlier creatures than Orcs for his armies. After reaching what he believed to be sufficient levels of soldiers, Morgoth's armies burst into Beleriand in the Dagor Bragollach. Accompanied by massive volcanic eruptions, the Orcs, Balrogs, and the dragon Glaurung completely overran the Elven defenses surrounding Angband, driving far into the south of Beleriand and slaughtering untold numbers of Elves. Fingolfin's kingdom in Hithlum managed barely to defend itself, as the mountains surrounding it provided protection against the flame and magma Morgoth had caused to spew from the Iron Mountains around Angband. But most of the other kingdoms of the Ñoldor were destroyed. The apparent totality of the defeat caused a great wrath and despair to overcome Fingolfin, and he resolved to go to Angband and challenge Morgoth himself to single combat. He mounted his horse and proceeded to ride across Anfauglith with such wrath that it was said that those who saw him mistook him for the Vala Oromë. He rode to Angband, unhindered by any of Morgoth's servants, smote upon the gates of Angband and shouted his challenge for all to hear, mocking Morgoth. Morgoth, though still said to be the ""mightiest of all things in this world"", was reluctant to face Fingolfin, because despite his might, he alone of the Valar knew fear. But Fingolfin's insults could not be ignored without Morgoth losing face before his captains. As such, he donned black armor, took up a great mace, and emerged from Angband. Fingolfin drew his sword, Ringil, and the duel began. Many times Morgoth attempted to smite Fingolfin, but the Elven King managed to dodge all of Morgoth's blows, and wounded the Dark Lord seven times. But after a time, Fingolfin grew weary, and Morgoth beat him to the ground three times. Fingolfin rose up and continued to fight each time, but as Mandos had foretold, no power of the Elves could defeat Morgoth, a Vala. Eventually, Fingolfin stumbled backwards into one of the many pits carved by Morgoth's failed strikes, and Morgoth stepped on the Elven King's neck and killed him. However, Fingolfin's last, desperate stroke managed to cut into Morgoth's heel.[7]
After defeating him, Morgoth took Fingolfin's body and broke it, intending to feed it to his wolves. But Thorondor, the King of Eagles, swooped down upon Morgoth and with his talons slashed at Morgoth's face. As Morgoth reeled from this new assault, Thorondor retrieved Fingolfin's body and brought it to a mountaintop overlooking Gondolin. Turgon built a cairn over the remains of his father, and Fingon, in sorrow, became High King of the Ñoldor. After Fingolfin's defeat, though he had been defeated by Morgoth, the Orcs never made any type of boastful song to celebrate, nor did the Elves sing of it, for their sorrow was far too great. Morgoth walked with a limp after the duel, and the wounds he received pained him forever.[7]

 Etymology 
Fingolfin's father-name was Ñolofinwë ""High Finwë"", from the Quenyan ngolod (""wise""). His mother-name is Arakáno ""High Chieftain"", from ara (""high"")[8] and káno (""chieftain"").[9] The name Fingolfin is the Sindarin form of his name.

 Biography 
Findis was the first child of Finwë and Indis, and Irimë her sister was the third child. Little is known about them except that Findis stayed with her mother Indis and her younger brother Finarfin (King of the Noldor in Aman) in Valinor, while her sister Irimë went to Middle-earth with her elder brother Fingolfin. Findis is a combination of both her parents' names.
Findis apparently continued to dwell in Aman and did not join the Revolt of the Ñoldor.[1]

Ñoldor (House of Finwë)



Írimë was a Ñoldor Elf, the daughter of Finwë, the High King of the Ñoldor and Indis; sister of Fingolfin, Finarfin, Findis, and half-sister of Fëanor.

Contents[show]
 Biography 
Írimë was born during the Noontide of Valinor, probably in Tirion. She was the third child of Finwë and Indis and their second daughter. Little is known about her except that Írimë joined the Revolt of the Ñoldor and went to Middle-earth with Fingolfin and his company.[1]
Írimë's fate is unknown but she may have been slain in one of the Battles of Beleriand but she could not have returned to Valinor before the end of the First Age, since no one of the Ñoldor could return there due to the Revolt of the Ñoldor.

 Etymology 
The name Írimë has unclear origins, both in language and meaning. Her mother-name was Lalwendë, or in shortened form, Lalwen, by which she was generally known. Lalwendë comes from Quenya and it means ""laughing maiden"".[2] It appears to me made from the words lala (""laugh"") and the feminine ending wendë (""maiden"").
In some versions she was known as Irien, which may have been her father-name. It is possible that both ""Írimë"" and ""Irien"" could have origins in the Quenyan words írissë and írë (""desire"") or perhaps the word ""írima"" (""lovely, desirable"").[3]

 Other versions of the legendarium 
In earlier versions of Tolkien's legendarium, Finwë and Indis had three daughters Findis, Faniel and Finvain. It remains unclear if the third daughter survived in the final conception of Finwë's family tree.[1]

Míriel Therindë [Quenya: Þerindë] or Míriel Serindë was the first wife of Finwë, the High King of the Ñoldor and the mother of Fëanor. Miriel's hair was described as being silver in appearance, an unusual color for one of the Ñoldor.[2] She was highly skilled in the art of weaving and needlework, and thus her amilessë (mother-name) was Þerindë, the Broideress.[4]
Contents[show]
 Biography 
    Finwe near his wife Miriel Serinde, by Steamey.  
Míriel married Finwë sometime during the Noontide of Valinor and they lived in Tirion. In YT 1169,[1] Míriel bore a son, called Curufinwë, whom she called Fëanáro which means ""Spirit of Fire"". After giving birth to him she could no longer live, and so wished to die, something which was impossible because, as an elf, she was immortal within Arda.
In YT 1170,[1] she laid down in his gardens where her fëa peacefully departed from her body, and she entered the Halls of Mandos: in essence losing her free will. Her body was tended by the maidens of Estë and remained preserved.[4][2] This was seen as a shocking event by the Valar, and eventually led to the second marriage of Finwë, and from there to the Rebellion of the Ñoldor and the First Kinslaying.[5]
After Finwë had been killed, Míriel was granted permission to return to life, where she entered the service of Vairë, her task to weave all the deeds of the House of Finwë in the Tapestry of Time.[6]

 Etymology 
Míriel means ""Jewel-woman"" or perhaps ""Jewel-daughter"", and her amilessë Þerindë ""Broideress"".[7] Serindë is a later version of her name after changes in the language of the Noldor. However, she requested that her kin continue to call her Þerindë (Þ is pronounced ""th"" so therindë ).[6]

 Character 
Míriel was described to have silver hair and a slender figure. Her customary singing while working was described as ""soft and sweet"".[2]

Brandir, known as Brandir the Lame, was a Lord of the Haladin in the First Age who dwelt in the Forest of Brethil which was west of Doriath in the settlement of Ephel Brandir, in Middle-earth.

Contents[show]
 Biography 
Brandir was born in FA 465 to Handir and Beldis who was a woman of the House of Bëor. Brandir was lamed by a leg broken in a misadventure in childhood. His disability resulted the appellations 'The Lame' and 'Clubfoot' being attached to his name. The latter was an insult used by Turin during his confrontation with Brandir following Niënor's death.
Brandir was a man of gentle mood, lover of plants and skilled healer. He was against open war with the Orcs because he hoped to preserve his people by silence and secrecy.
When Túrin Turambar arrived in the Forest of Brethil, Brandir was opposed to him and suspected that Túrin Turambar would bring misfortune onto the community. However he took Túrin, who was dying of grief after the death of Finduilas, into his house and tended him until he recovered. Later on Brandir also accepted the woman Nienor, whom soon he secretly fell in love with.
During Túrin's foray to kill the dragon Glaurung, Brandir observed the drama from afar and overheard Glaurung telling Nienor who she really was. Brandir reported this news later to Túrin, who did not believe him, and killed him in anger in FA 499.[2][3][4]

 Etymology 
Brandir means 'lofty or noble man' in Sindarin.[citation needed]","

""Farewell, O twice beloved! Túrin Turambar turun ambartanen: Master of Doom, by Doom mastered! O happy to be dead!!""
—Niënor Níniel, ""The Death of Glaurung""

Niënor, also called Níniel, was Húrin and Morwen's third child, the sister of Túrin Turambar. She was born in Hithlum in the year of Nírnaeth Arnoediad. After this battle, the Easterlings settled in the land and oppressed the people of Hador.

Contents[show]
 Biography 
Nienor remained in Hithlum with her mother Morwen for twenty years, subsequently moving to Doriath in hopes of finding Túrin, who has been sent there earlier. After she and her mother heard a rumour that the mysterious Mormegil of Nargothrond was actually Túrin, they set out with a company of Elves for that place. Unfortunately, the dragon Glaurung had just sacked that Elven city, and, sensing their approach, he caused a cloud of foul vapor to rise from the Narog. The party's horses panicked and Niënor was separated, at which point the worm Glaurung used his famous abilities to put her in a state of total amnesia.

    Glaurung and Nienor by Rirth  
Eventually, the amnesiac woman was found by Mablung, who intended to take her back to Doriath but they were attacked by orcs while attempting to cross the Taeglin. In confusion and terror, Niënor ran away, tore off her clothes and ran naked through the forest until she fainted.
Her brother Túrin found her, naked and terrified, at Haudh-en-Elleth, lying on the grave of his dead lover Finduilas. Because Niënor did not remember her identity and Túrin did not know his sister, as he had never seen her before, he named her Níniel which means ""Tear-Maiden"", and brought her to safety at Brethil.

    Niënor being cursed by Glaurung, by Lelek1980  
The men of Brethil returned to Ephel Brandir soon after. When ""Níniel"" fell sick, Brandir tended to her, secretly falling in love. However, ""Níniel"" loved Túrin more, and after three years, they were wed. By the next spring, she was halfway through her first pregnancy.
It was then that rumours of Glaurung's approach reached Túrin, who went out to slay him. Unfortunately, the dragon envenomed him even as he dealt the worm a mortal blow, and Túrin fell into a swoon.
At this unfortunate moment, ""Níniel"", who feared for her husband's life, went out and found him apparently dead. Glaurung then set off his hidden weapon against Túrin - he removed Niënor's amnesia with his last words. Realising she had married her own brother and was carrying his unborn child, she committed suicide by throwing herself into the ravine at Cabed-en-Aras. Her death sparked a series of events culminating in his suicide, thus fulfilling Glaurung's vengeance.[2][4]

 Etymology 
Niënor means ""mourning"" and Níniel means ""tear-maiden"" in Sindarin.[5]

He was one of Skinbark's people, and made his home on the mountain-slopes west of Isengard until the orcs cut down his forest. Having no other choice, he then moved to an ent-house near Derndingle in Fangorn.
At the Entmoot, Bregalad lived up to his reputation for hastiness; he was the first ent that decided to attack Isengard, since Saruman's orcs had destroyed many of his rowan groves. Seeing that Bregalad's mind had already been made up, Treebeard then sent him to watch over Merry and Pippin while the debate among the other ents continued. He sang songs and laughed with the hobbits; they stayed at his ent-house near Derndingle, where the Entmoot was held.[1]
Bregalad later played an important role in the Destruction of Isengard, as he fought alongside Treebeard and nearly captured Saruman himself. After the water from Isen River had flooded Isengard, he stood guard at the bottom of the stairs of Orthanc. After the War of the Ring, his fate is unknown.

 Portrayal in adaptations 
    Quickbeam's appearance in The Lord of the Rings Online  
In The Lord of the Rings Online Quickbeam is found in the grove near Nan Curunir mourning the loss of his tree-friends. He asks the player to exact vengeance upon Orcs and Uruks and deprive them of the means to hurt even more trees.
In LEGO The Lord of the Rings: The Video Game, the player can choose either using Treebeard or another lighter-colored Ent to destroy Isengard, which is assumed by some to be Quickbeam. Both of them have the same abilities and speed.

 Etymology 
Bregalad is a Sindarin name and roughly translates as ""Quickbeam"" (from bragol and galad which means ""sudden"" and ""tree""). He received this nickname when he answered ""yes"" before an elder Ent had finished asking the question; this also showed his ""hasty"" temper for his race.[2]

 Trivia 
 Although Quickbeam does not expressly appear in The Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers film adaptation, there is a ""Rowan Ent"" seen in the film that many fans have taken to be Quickbeam pared down to a non-speaking role.
 ""Quickbeam"" is the internet pseudonym of Cliff Broadway, a Senior Staff at TheOneRing.net.

Amandil was the leader of the Faithful in Númenor, and came to be the eighteenth and last Lord of Andúnie. His life as Lord of Andúnie and as one of the Faithful sired the High Kings of Gondor and Arnor who preserved their ways through the Dúnedain of Middle-earth on up to Aragorn II Elessar. Elendil the Tall was his son, and Isildur his grandson.

Contents[show]
 Biography 
In the youth of Amandil he had great friendship with Pharazôn who had kinship with him through his father's mother Inzilbêth.
When Pharazôn married Tar-Míriel and he took the Scepter of Númenor he became corrupted by his father's counsel and Pharazôn and Amandil became estranged. Amandil, who was the leader of the Faithful in Númenor though not openly, supported the ban of the Valar and for the old traditions whereas Pharazôn followed the counsel of his father and that of his own will. Pharazôn deprived the Lords of Andúnië of their lordship due to their support of the old King Tar-Palantir and he commanded Amandil to dwell in Rómenna. Andúnië he took and made it to his chief harbour of his ships but he did not dismiss him from his council or in any other way molest him.
In SA 3261, Pharazôn brought Sauron (who was disguised) to Númenor, and over the years became deceived by Sauron's lies.
Eventually sensing the impending doom of Númenor, he urged his son Elendil not to interfere in the upcoming war, but to expect and prepare for a forced departure from the island. He himself decided to set sail for Valinor, there to plead with the Valar for forgiveness and mercy for the Númenórean people, since at least a few had remained faithful.
He departed into the West either SA 3310[1] and SA 3316[1], just before the Great Armament was ready to launch in an attempt to reach Valinor and save Númenor. He set sail in a small ship with three servants dear to him (though no names are given for them) at night from Rómenna steering East, like it was his goal to reach Middle-earth, but soon he turned and journeyed into the West. He never returned, and was never heard from again.
Whether Amandil's voyage was successful is unknown, but soon after the destruction of Númenor, a great wave carried Elendil's ships safely to Middle-earth, suggesting that his pleas were indeed heard.[2]

 Etymology 
Amandil's name means ""Lover of Aman"" or perhaps ""Devoted to Aman"" in Quenya.[3]

 Other versions of the legendarium 
In Tolkien's unfinished time-travel story ""The Lost Road"" Amandil has the name Valandil, ""friend of Gods"", which for a high court official in the later days of Pharazon would have been ill-favored. Tolkien's intentions for changing the name are unspecified.

Ar-Pharazôn, also known as Ar-Pharazôn the Golden, was the twenty-fifth and last King of Númenor. Of all the Kings of Númenor, he wielded the most power, but used it most unwisely; his desire for eternal life caused the destruction of Númenor and the Change of the World.

Contents[show]
 Biography 
Ar-Pharazôn was the son of Gimilkhâd, the leader of the King's Men during the reign of Tar-Palantir of Númenor. Ar-Pharazôn grew into a Man of great strength, stature, and will, not unlike the ancient heroes of the Edain. In these earlier days, he was good friends with his distant kin Amandil, the future Lord of Andúnië and his line of people. However, he was his father's child and thus was instructed in the ways of the King's Men.
Ar-Pharazôn became a man of great pride and aquired a hunger for wealth and glory. He grew restless in his homeland and was often abroad leading like-minded Númenóreans in the wars against the men of Middle-earth. In this he fared well on both land and sea for he won great wealth, and gained great respect as a captain. When he finally returned home, the people rejoiced in him and he was very popular and generous with the wealth and fortunes he won in Middle-earth.
Upon the death of his uncle, Tar-Palantir, who had no son, Ar-Pharazôn decided to wed his daughter, Míriel, which was against her will. As Tar-Míriel was the rightful Ruling Queen of Númenor, Ar-Pharazôn was able to usurp the throne. He gave to his wife the name Ar-Zimraphel, refusing to use the Elven speech, whilst persecuting the last vestiges of the Faithful.
As time passed, it came to his attention that Sauron, the Lord of Mordor, was expanding his power throughout Middle-earth and was being called the Lord of Men. Ar-Pharazôn, ever prideful, resolved to challenge him lordship of the earth. In SA 3261, he marched upon Mordor with an army so powerful that Sauron's forces simply deserted him. But Sauron was cunning, and he feigned to be overawed at Ar-Pharazôn's might. The Númenorean king did not trust Sauron, and brought him back to Númenor as a hostage. However, Sauron quickly took advantage of his situation to gain Ar-Pharazôn's trust, and by way of careful flattery, lies and half-truths, he soon became the king's closest and most trusted advisor. He was able to corrupt Ar-Pharazôn, convincing him to worship Morgoth in the hope that he would be able to cheat mortality. Some of the results of Sauron's cunning were the erecting of a Great Temple to Morgoth, intense persecution of the Faithful, and the chopping down of the White Tree of Númenor. Soon the king and his followers were worshiping Morgoth openly and burning innocents at the altar of the temple as sacrificial offerings to appease the false god.
Then, as Ar-Pharazôn felt the bite of old age upon him, Sauron was able to convince him to attack Valinor and claim the right to immortality by force. He began the building of a huge fleet, the Great Armament, to attack Valinor in SA 3310 and finally broke the Ban of the Valar, landing on the shores of the Undying Lands in SA 3319. The Valar then laid down their guardianship of the world and called upon Eru, the One. He sank Ar-Pharazôn's fleet and all of Númenor beneath the ocean, changing the shape of the world. Valinor was no longer connected to Middle-earth, and mortals could no longer find it. Afterwards, only elves and a few remarkable exceptions could reach it following the Straight Road into the far west. Ar-Pharazôn and his mighty host who landed on Aman were buried by mounds of dirt and remain in the Caves of the Forgotten until the last battle, or Dagor Dagorath. He and his great army's role in the end of days has not been made clear.

 Legacy and successors 
Ar-Pharazôn's tyrannical rule and rebellious resolve to break the Ban of the Valar and make war upon the west led to the end of the royal Númenórean line. Instead, the line of Elros was continued from the long line of the Lords of Andúnië, begun through Elros' great-granddaughter Silmariën and her son Valandil, the first Lord of Andúnië. As Amandil of Andúnië did not return from his venture into the west, his son Elendil became the successor of a new kingdom that would rule from Middle-earth in exile. His two surviving sons, Isildur and Anárion followed him into exile and would, in turn, become his successors as well.
Ar-Pharazôn was remembered by the surviving Númenorean lineage with a sort of grudging respect. Despite his errors, he was the first and last Human capable to beat and humiliate the powerful dark lord Sauron by himself. In remembrance to this feat, in Umbar was erected a monument to the Golden King of Númenor: a dark crystal globe, on a tall white column, which absorbed sunrays and glimmered in the night for everyone to see. The monument was destroyed when Umbar corsairs swore allegiance to Sauron.[3][1][4][5]

 Etymology 
His chosen royal name of Pharazôn which means ""Golden"" was in Adûnaic; his name in Quenya was Tar-Calion with Calion meaning ""Son of Light"".

Maeglin was an Elf, the son of Eöl the ""Dark Elf"", and Aredhel, daughter of Fingolfin. He lived during the First Age of the Sun in Middle-earth, and was a lord of the hidden Elven kingdom of Gondolin. He became infamous for his betrayal of the location of the city of Gondolin to the Dark Lord Morgoth.

Contents[show]
 Biography 
Aredhel had left Gondolin to wander through Beleriand, and in the woods of Nan Elmoth, she met Eöl, and stayed with him, eventually giving birth to Maeglin. Eöl gave his child the name Maeglin when he was twelve. His mother told him about Gondolin and its people throughout his childhood and he desired to see his related kin in the Hidden City. He and his mother soon grew weary and discontented with their life in Nan Elmoth and Eöl's strict shunning of the outside world. When Aredhel finally decided to leave Eöl, she took her son (who stole his father's sword, Anguirel, forged of meteoric iron) with her and returned to Gondolin. However, Eöl had followed her, and in judgment before Turgon, he attempted to kill Maeglin with a poisoned dart, but hit Aredhel instead. She died, and Eöl was cast down to his death from the city walls.
Maeglin was now an orphan, but Turgon held him in honor, and Maeglin both learned and taught much. He became an elven-prince held in high esteem, even leading his own noble house. He found rich loads of metals in the Echoriath surrounding the city and forged weapons of steel stronger than had been seen before. His mine in the Echoriath was named Anghabar, ""Iron Mine"". In the Nirnaeth Arnoediad, Maeglin refused to remain behind as regent, and went forth to battle with Turgon. The seventh and final gate of Gondolin, the Great Gate of Steel, was Maeglin's creation.
Even though Maeglin was one of the mighty of Gondolin, his greatest desire was to take Turgon's daughter Idril to be his wife. But his desire was in vain, for Idril was his own first cousin, and as such was considered by Elven society to be too close in kinship with Maeglin to allow for any romantic relationship. Additionally, Idril was well aware of Maeglin's thoughts concerning her and despised him for it.
When Tuor came, carrying Ulmo's warning of the danger to Gondolin, Maeglin sat on the right hand of Turgon and argued against Tuor. The arguments made by Maeglin were instrumental in convincing Turgon not to leave Gondolin despite Ulmo's warnings, which ultimately resulted in the near-complete slaughter of the city's people. Seven years later, Tuor and Idril were wed and Idril bore a son, Eärendil, further increasing Maeglin's hate. Some time later, Maeglin was captured by orcs while seeking for metals outside of the Encircling Mountains. He was brought to Angband and taken before Morgoth himself, who knew that Maeglin dwelt in Gondolin and was eager to learn its location. He threatened Maeglin with unimaginable torment, and though Maeglin was no craven, he was cowed by Morgoth's threats and betrayed the location and weaknesses of Gondolin in exchange for his freedom. Morgoth was overjoyed to obtain this information, and to further encourage Maeglin and ensure both his silence and his further aid, Morgoth promised him both rule of the city and the hand of Idril once Turgon was overthrown. Maeglin assented eagerly to this bargain. Afterwards, Morgoth released him and he returned to Gondolin without suspicion. When the hosts of Morgoth attacked and overran the city, Maeglin sought to capture Idril and fought with Tuor on the walls. But Tuor prevailed, and threw him from the wall to his death.
Maeglin was a relatively young elf, being merely 190 years old at the time of his death.[1]

 Etymology 
Îon was the first name given to Maeglin, by Eöl, which simply meant 'son'. [3] His later and common name Maeglin means ""sharp glance"" in Sindarin, with Maeg (in Quenya maika) meaning 'sharp, piercing' and glin meaning 'gleam'. At birth, Aredhel secretly gave Maeglin the name of Lómion, signifying ""Child of the Twilight"" in the Quenya tongue.[4]
Morleg was the original and rejected name for him, as found in The War of the Jewels.

Female


Culture
Edain (House of Marach)



Adanel was a wise woman from the House of Marach. She was a daughter of Malach and his wife, Zimrahin, and the older sister of Magor. It was mentioned that Adanel had many other brothers and sisters as well, and like Magor her brother, they also might have been younger than she.

Contents[show]
 Biography 
Adanel ended up marrying Belemir of the House of Bëor, a great-grandson of Bëor the Old himself. Adanel was the mother of five children and her fifth and last child was a son Beren.[1] Adanel's son Beren later was the grandfather of his great namesake grandson the renowned Beren Erchamion (Beren the One-handed) of whom his daughter the famed Emeldir the Man-hearted named after him. Thus, Adanel was the great-grandmother of Beren son of Emeldir, her granddaughter.
The Wise of the People of Marach were the only Men to preserve the tale of their original sin, when, soon after their awakening, the Men chose to worship Melkor instead of Eru. Adanel told this tale (called the Tale of Adanel in Morgoth's Ring) to Andreth of the House of Bëor.
Andreth was a very distant niece of Adanel's husband Belemir through the line of Baran, the eldest son of Bëor, and Belemir through the line of his grandfather Belen who was the youngest son of Bëor. In addition, Andreth's nephew Barahir married Adanel's granddaughter Emeldir.[2]

 Etymology 
The name Adanel was a Sindarin name of unclear meaning. It is likely to have come from the words adan, meaning 'man' (as a race, rather than in gender), and el, meaning 'star'. This would give the meanings ""star of man"" or perhaps ""man of the star"" to her name.

 Biography 
Tar-Ardamin was the son of King Tar-Calmacil, and if he was counted as one of the rulers, then he was the nineteenth in the line of rulers. In Adûnaic his name meant ""Pillar of the World""; in Quenya, it may have meant ""First of the World"". His son, Ar-Adûnakhôr, was generally counted as the twentieth ruler.[citation needed]","

Ar-Adûnakhôr was the twentieth King of Númenor. He was best known as the first Númenórean king to take his official name in the Adûnaic tongue instead of using the traditional Quenya form Tar-Herunúmen.[1][2]

Contents[show]
 Biography 
As an opponent of the Valar, Ar-Adûnakhôr his Quenya name was recorded in the official royal scrolls only. The name he chose was considered by some as blasphemous in both languages it means ""Lord of the West"", a title reserved for Manwë, Lord of the Valar. During his time, the Elven-tongues were no longer used or taught to children, and the ships from Tol Eressëa came rarely. Only those of The Faithful maintained the ancient customs of friendship with the west and welcomed the Eldar, both in secret.[2]
There is some question as to whether Ar-Adûnakhôr succeeded his father, Tar-Ardamin, as king, or his grandfather, Tar-Calmacil, but the numbering of the rulers includes Tar-Ardamin in the count. Specifically, Tar-Ardamin does not appear at all in the The Lord of the Rings appendices, but he does appear in the chapter ""The Line of Elros"" from Unfinished Tales.
Ar-Adûnakhôr ruled for sixty-three years and was succeeded by his son, Ar-Zimrathôn in SA 2962.[1]

Beleg, also known as Beleg Cúthalion or Beleg Strongbow, dubbed for his good bowmanship, was a Sindarin elf who served in the army of King Elu Thingol of Doriath as Chief Marchwarden[2][3] - and was a predominant companion of Túrin Turambar.

Contents[show]
 Biography 
    Beleg Departs Menegroth, by Alan Lee  
Beleg ""followed no man"", and ""could not be restrained"". He and his friend Mablung were the only Elves of Doriath to fight with the Union of Maedhros in the Nirnaeth Arnoediad, as King Thingol would have nothing to do with the war.[4]
Together with Mablung he was one of the great captains of the Sindar, and he was part of the Hunting of the Great Wolf Carcharoth during the trials of Beren and Lúthien.[5]

    Beleg receives Anglachel, by Alan Lee  
Later, he became a good friend and brother-in-arms of Túrin Turambar, a young Man of Dor-lómin. When Túrin left Doriath, Beleg got permission from Thingol to follow him into exile and bring him the king's pardon, wielding the black sword Anglachel that Eöl had forged and given to Thingol in tribute.[6] Beleg found the band of outlaws Túrin was leading while Túrin was away scouting, and was tortured by some of them until Túrin found and released him. Unable to persuade Túrin to return to Doriath with him, Beleg returned to King Thingol and gained permission to join Túrin in his free exploits.[7] He went into the wilds again and found Túrin on Amon Rûdh.[8] Together with Túrin, wearing the Dragon-helm of Dor-lómin, he became for a while a captain against Morgoth, and the land they dwelt in became known as the Land of Bow and Helm or Dor-Cuarthol in Sindarin.[9]

    Beleg is Slain, by Ted Nasmith  
When Túrin was captured by the Orcs, Beleg was grievously wounded, yet with the knowledge and strength of an elite elven warrior, he recovered and followed the Orcs. He met the escaped thrall Gwindor in Taur-nu-Fuin and together they rescued Túrin, but as Beleg cut the bonds from Túrin's wrists and ankles he slipped, accidentally cutting Túrin with his sword. Túrin awoke and did not recognize Beleg in the darkness, assuming the shape bent over him with a blade was an orc and that he was to be tortured again. In a sudden rage of self-defense, he wrested the sword from Beleg and killed him.[10][11]
After his death Túrin made the song Laer Cú Beleg, The Song of the Great Bow, and was known to sing it at times of grief and pain, in honor of his fallen friend and comrade.[11][12]

 Etymology 
In Sindarin, Beleg means ""mighty"".[13] His epessë (i.e. surname) Cúthalion means ""Strongbow"", from the Sindarin cu (""bow"") and thalion (""strong, dauntless"").[14][15][16]

 Weapons 
He wielded the sword Anglachel, forged by Eol, and given to Beleg by King Thingol. His bow was called Belthronding[11] and his arrow was Dailir.

 Other versions of the legendarium 
In early writings, Beleg was not immediately killed by Túrin. After an ambush, Túrin was taken alive and Beleg was left for dead. He was eventually healed of his wounds by Melian, which allowed him to continue in search for his friend. He came upon Gwindor in Taur-nu-Fuin, and together they rescued Túrin. However, Túrin slew Beleg by misadventure.[17]

Elros, also known as Elros Tar-Minyatur, the Half-elven, was the son of Eärendil and Elwing, brother of Elrond, uncle of Elladan and Elrohir and Arwen Undómiel, and the first King of Númenor; ancestor to a line of kings especially to his descendant Aragorn II Elessar. He had a strong friendship with the Elves, who were half his kin.
Contents[show]
 Biography 
 First Age 

In FA 532, Elros was born in Arvernien. In the assault of the Third Kinslaying by the Sons of Fëanor, Elros and Elrond were taken captive by Maglor and Maedhros. Later, Elwing, their mother, cast herself into the great Belegaer and vanished from Middle-earth.[3]
From then on, Elros and his brother were raised by Maglor. They were both raised in love for Maglor was not proud of his deeds. It is nowhere told when or if Elros and Elrond actually left Maglor but it can be assumed that at the time of Eönwë's arrival they took full part in the war.[3]
In FA 547,[1] the host of Eönwë and the Valar were seen shining upon the sea and the noise of Eönwë`s trumpets rang over the waves. Eönwë summoned all of the Elves and all of the men from Hithlum to the South, rallying them for the great war against Melkor that was now to come.[3]

 Second Age 
    Elros Half-elven  
Eventually the War of Wrath ended. As Elros and Elrond were Peredhil, or Half-elven, and only in these two remained the line of heroic chieftains of Men in the First Age. The Valar gave to Elrond and Elros the choice of which kindred they would belong to. Elros chose to be of Man-kind and as such he was granted a great life-span. Eonwë came among the faithful humans and he taught them and gave them wisdom, power, and a life longer than any others of mortal race, but none of the high men ever reached the age of Elros. And a great land was made for them; not a part of Middle-earth and not wholly separate from it. This land was Númenor, and Elros was its first king.[4]
Númenor was raised from the depths of the sea by Ossë, established by Aulë and enriched by Yavanna. The Elves brought flowers and fountains out of Tol Eressëa from Avallónë and wrought gardens in Númenor. The Valar called it Andor, The Land of Gift, and its own people called it Westernessë, for it lay west of all the lands inhabited by Mortals.[4]
When Elros was 90 years old, he ascended the throne of Númenor in the city of Armenelos where he was inscribed as Elros Tar-Minyatur. The sword Aranrúth which once was his great-great-grandfather Thingol's sword, the Serpent Ring, and Dramborleg, the Axe of Tuor became heirlooms of the Kings of Númenor.[5] During his time as king, Elros had four children to an unnamed mortal wife. They included three sons, Vardamir Nólimon, Manwendil, and Atanalcar, and a daughter, Tindómiel.[6]
Elros died in SA 442, after ruling Númenor for 410 years.[4][7][8]

 Trivia 
 Elros' lifespan was 500 years, and he started ruling Numenor at an old age (90), but he gave up his life willingly, so the oldest age Elros could ever have been is unknown.
 He could possibly be related to the Valar, as his ancestor Melian the Maia was a distant relative of Yavanna and Vána, who are Valar.
 Elros' descendants never lived up to his age; his descendant Aragorn only lived up to 210 years, which was less than half his age. In fact the oldest King/Queen of Numenor other than Elros was Tar-Atanamir, who lived up to 421 years, 79 years less than Elros' lifespan. It was, however, stated that Elros' life and reign were particularly long, even by the standards of his lineage, which could be attributed to his parentage.
 Elros reign over Numenor was nearly twice as long as Aragorn's age.

 Etymology 
Elros was a Sindarin word that meant ""Elf of the spray"", from el (""elf"" or ""star"", interchangeably) and ross (""foam, spray"").[9][10] The name came from the Quenyan word Elerossë.[11]
Tar-Minyatur was a Quenyan word that meant ""High First-ruler"" in the High-Elven tongue,[11] from tar (""king""), minya (""first"") and túrë (""master, lord"").[12] Afterwards this was the convention by which most succeeding Kings of Númenor took their royal title.

 Earlier Names 
In earlier versions, the Adûnaic name for Elros was Indilzar Azrabelo, and later changed to Gimilzôr. Later, the name Gimilzôr was given to the twenty-third King of Númenor.[13]

Eönwë (Quenya; IPA: [eˈonʷe]) was a Maia serving Manwë as his herald and banner-bearer, and Chief of the Maiar along with Ilmarë.

Contents[show]
 Biography 
Eönwë was referred to as the ""greatest of arms in Arda,"" meaning that he was the best with weapons, but as one of the Maiar he was not necessarily the most powerful in might.[1] When the appeal of Eärendil reached the shores of Aman, it was Eönwë who first greeted him outside of Tirion praising his arrival and accomplishments. When Manwë decided to heed the appeal, Eönwë was sent to Middle-earth to fight the War of Wrath, leading the Host of the Valar.
When Morgoth the Black Foe was defeated, Eönwë took the two remaining Silmarils and held them for safekeeping. The two remaining Sons of Fëanor took them and fled, yet Eönwë did not let them be slain hoping they would see the folly of their ways.[2] After the War of Wrath, Sauron emerged from hiding and approached Eönwë seeking forgiveness, but Eönwë did not have the authority to pardon him alone, and told him he would have to return to the Valar to receive judgment, but Sauron fled from him instead.[3]
Eönwë also possessed great wisdom and taught the remaining Edain many things, enriching them with great knowledge before the raising of Númenor.[4]

 Etymology 
 Earlier names 
    Fionwë Úrion as the son of Manwë and Urwendi in the early versions of the legendarium, by ANDREI RIABOVITCHEV  
Although the name Eönwë does not have any particular meaning in either Quenya or Sindarin, his earlier name Fionwë translates to ""Son"", from fion[5] and the suffix -wë,[6]an old word for ""person"", deriving from the stem from EWE.[7] This possibly alludes to his previous conception as the son of Manwë.
His other name, Úrion, means ""He of the Sun"", from ur (""the Sun""), uru (""fire"") or urin (""blazing""),[5] and the masculine suffix -ion.[8]

Other versions of the legendarium
In earlier conceptions of the legendarium, Eönwë, then called Fionwë Úrion, was envisioned as the son of Manwë and brother of Erinti, renamed Ilmarë, Varda's handmaiden.[9] In some versions, Fionwë, later named Eönwë, is the one who will kill Morgoth for his love for Urwendi (later named Arien).[10]

Ilmarë (Quenya; IPA: [ˈilmare] - ""Starlight"") was chief amongst the Maiar and the handmaiden to Queen Varda.[1]  Ilmarë was greatest and most powerful of all the Maiar.

Contents[show]
 Biography 
Ilmarë was the handmaiden of Varda, thereby a guardian spirit of the stars, and one of the chiefs of the Maiar, along with Eönwë, the Herald and Banner-Bearer of King Manwë.[1]

 Etymology 
In Quenya, Ilmarë means ""Starlight"", from ilma.[2] Christopher Tolkien has noted that Ilmarë is related to such words as Ilmen and Ilmarin.[3]
Her name was possibly inspired by Kalevala, where one of the heroes is called Ilmarinen.

 Other versions of the legendarium 
Earlier in the legendarium, Ilmarë and Eönwë were conceived as the son and daughter of Manwë and Varda, previously referred to as Erinti and Fionwë Urion. Later, Tolkien abandoned the idea of the Children of the Valar.[4]
As Erinti, she was a Valië here of love, music, and beauty, also named Lotesse and Akairis (""bride""), sister of Noldorin and Amillo. The three of them left Valinor and dwelt in Inwenore (later Tol Eressëa). The second half of January was called Enrintion, which was named after her.[5]

Maiar (Maia of Ulmo)



Uinen (Sindarin; IPA: [ˈuɪnen] - ""Ever Water"") was a Maia spirit known as The Lady of the Sea and the wife of the Maia Ossë. She was a matron to all mariners. Uinen was third greatest and most powerful of all the Maiar.

Contents[show]
Biography
Before the Sun and the Moon
Uinen loves all creatures that lived in the saltwater streams of the world and the weeds that grew in them. Her love calmed the violent tidal waves and storms created by Ossë her husband by keeping him in line and not going too far. Her hair spread throughout waters and lies on their surfaces. During the early days Arda, Ossë rebelled against his Lord Ulmo (Lord of All Waters) and served Melkor instead, being carried away by the false promises that Melkor gave to him. From then on, for a while, there rose great tumults in the sea that wrought great ruins to the lands. At that point, and also because of the prayers of Aulë who created those lands, Uinen helped bring Ossë back to the allegiance of their lord Ulmo by restraining her husand and bringing him before Ulmo. Following that, Uinen's husband was pardoned and gave his allegiance back to the Valar remaining thereafter faithful then ever to them.[1] To the Maiar Uinen and Ossë, Ulmo their lord gave them the task of the governing of the waves and the movements of the Inner Seas. Plus ever afterwards, Uinen was the one who restrained her Spouse's violence in the seas and on the coasts.[2]
Later on, the Teleri remained long on the coast of the western seas, awaiting still for Ulmo to take them to Aman. Likewise, Uinen and Ossë came among the Teleri at the coasts and befriended them. In addition, the Teleri had much love for Uinen and her spouse, for Uinen and Ossë continued being friends with the Teleri who then dwelt by the mouths of the great river Sirion of Beleriand which flowed into the sea.[3] Ultimately, the Teleri with their King Olwë at last reached Aman where they built their dwelling as a city-haven named 'Alqualondë' on the shores of Eldamar in Aman. However later on, the 'Kinslaying at Alqualondë' took place at the Swanhaven of the Teleri where Fëanor, eldest son of King Finwë of the Ñoldor, and his host of exiled Ñoldor attacked the Teleri and forcefully stole their white ships for their voyage to Middle-earth. Notwithstanding though, Uinen wept for the many of the Telerin mariners who had been wickedly slain and tossed into the sea. What's more, the sea then rose in great wrath by Uinen against the Noldorin slayers in that so many of the Telerin ships were wrecked and those of the Ñoldor in them were drowned.[4]
When the Hiding of Valinor took place, Ossë raised the enchanted Isles. Then next, Uinen enchanted those who ever managed to reach the Isles by weaving them in her hair before Irmo (Master of Dreams & Desires) put them to age-long sleep.[5]

Second Age
In the Second Age, the mariners of Númenór would cry to Uinen for help, because she was the only one capable of calming Ossë who loved to create tumults in the seas. And the Númenóreans lived under her protection while their respect for the Valar endured. Therefore, the Númenóreans held the Maia Uinen in reverence as equal to the Valar.[1]

 Other versions of the legendarium 
In a Númenórean legend, it was told that Uinen had the Isle of Tol Uinen placed in the Bay of Rómenna as a gift to the people of Númenór.[1]
In the original story of the Sun and the Moon, it was Uinen herself who wove the sails for the ship of the Moon. Uinen had made them as white mists and foam and some were spread like glittering scales of silver fish while others were threaded with tiny stars looking like points of light.[6]

Maiar of Ulmo



Salmar was a Maia, creator of the Ulumúri. Made for his lord Ulmo, the Ulumúri were great conches who produced the music of the sea.

Contents[show]
 Biography 
The index of The Silmarillion lists Salmar as a Maia, though the provenance of this entry is unknown as no other texts describe Salmar as being one of the Maiar. However, as he is a spirit who accompanied Ulmo without being regarded as one of the Valar, the conclusion that Salmar was a Maiar seems logical.[1]

 Etymology 
Salmar is a Quenyan name of unknown meaning. It may possibly be derived from the Quenyan word Salma, meaning lyre.[2]

 Earlier versions of the legendarium 
In earlier conceptions of the legendarium discussed in The History of Middle-earth, Salmar is often identified by the title Noldorin (sometimes ""Lirillo"" or ""Golthadriel"" in Gnomish). He was envisioned as a Vala in the service of Aulë.[3]

""Late is the hour in which this conjurer chooses to appear. Lathspell I name him. Ill news is an ill guest.""
—Gríma Wormtongue to Gandalf, in The Two Towers

Gríma Wormtongue was the chief advisor to King Théoden of Rohan before being exposed as an agent and spy of Saruman. He ends up being the killer of Saruman, in the last climactic chapter of The Return of the King.

Contents[show]
 Biography 
Little is known of Gríma before he became counselor of Théoden in Edoras. His childhood is a mystery. What is known is that Gríma, son of Gálmód, and a native of Rohan, joined the service of Saruman in secret and worked as a spy to weaken Théoden and his kingdom, using his voice to keep the spell intact while Saruman is inside the King.

    Gríma with Éowyn  
It is likely that Saruman had promised him Éowyn, the king's niece, as a reward for his services; in the novel, Wormtongue is accused of ""watching her under his lids and haunting her steps"" and in the film, he makes clumsy romantic overtures to her as she weeps for her dead cousin Théodred. He also exiles Éowyn's brother Éomer and his army from Rohan, only saying that he sees ""too much"" after Éomer says, ""Too long have you watched my sister, too long have you haunted her steps"". It is also possible that he has Dunlending ancestry, since he is darker-haired and physically smaller than the other Rohirrim.

    Gríma and King Théoden as Saruman in his spell as Gandalf enters Meduseld  
After Gandalf usurps Gríma's control of Théoden and releases the King, ""many things which men had missed"" were found locked in his trunk, including Herugrim, the blade of Théoden. With his betrayal revealed, Théoden presents Gríma with a choice: either ride into battle for the King or be exiled. Choosing the latter, he went to dwell with Saruman at Orthanc. In the book, Gríma arrived at Orthanc after the battle of the Ents, but in the movie, he was there before the battle began. There, Gríma gave Saruman important information about Théoden's plans to leave Edoras with his people suspecting an attack would come, and that they would flee to Helm's Deep, the main fortress of Rohan, where the Battle of the Hornburg would be fought. Later, Saruman had cause to regret Gríma's dwelling in Orthanc when, following the confrontation between Saruman and Gandalf, he foolishly threw a ""heavy rock""— which was actually the Palantír of Orthanc at either Gandalf or Saruman (it is stated that ""he couldn't decide which he hated most""), an act for which Saruman seems to have punished him severely (Pippin picked up the Palantír). Saruman was also said to have scalped Gríma and beaten him over time.[1]
Gríma then accompanied Saruman to the Shire, where the two sought revenge in petty tyranny over the hobbits (though Saruman had already been exerting control from afar by sending evil Men to the Shire). During this time, Gríma became increasingly degraded until he was a crawling wretch, a beggar, almost resembling Gollum, and Saruman shortened his nickname to ""Worm"". Gríma killed Lotho Sackville-Baggins and may have eaten him, which he claims to have done in the book under Saruman's orders.
Spurred by the words of Frodo that he did not have to follow Saruman, and having been pushed over the edge when Saruman scorned him, Gríma used a hidden knife to slit Saruman's throat, killing him (only in the book). He then tried to make his escape, but was quickly killed by several arrows fired from the hobbits present, ending his short and unhappy life.[2]

 Unfinished Tales 
Gríma actually played a major role in the story of The Lord of the Rings prior to his first appearance in The Two Towers. In Unfinished Tales, Tolkien writes that on the 20th of September in 3018 Gríma was captured by the Nazgûl in the fields of Rohan, while on his way to Isengard to inform Saruman of Gandalf's arrival at Edoras. He was interrogated and divulged what he knew of Saruman's plans to the Nazgûl, specifically his interest in the Shire, and its location. Previously, the location of the Shire had been unknown to the Nazgûl, but they knew it to be the home of 'Baggins', whom they thought still had the Ring.
Gríma was set free, but only because the Lord of the Nazgûl saw that he would not dare tell anyone of their meeting and might do harm to Saruman in the future. The Nazgûl set out immediately for the Shire. Had the Ringwraiths not captured Gríma, they would instead have pursued Gandalf into Rohan, and possibly not have found the Shire until much later, giving the Hobbits and then the Fellowship a considerable head start.[3]

 Portrayal in adaptations 
 Ralph Bakshi's Lord of the Rings film 
In Ralph Bakshi's 1978 animated film of The Lord of the Rings, Gríma Wormtongue was voiced by Michael Deacon (and his name is pronounced as ""Gree-ma""). Here he is much smaller than is implied in the book. Paul Brooke played Gríma in BBC Radio's 1981 serialisation.

 Peter Jackson's Lord of the Rings trilogy 
    Gríma Wormtongue from The Lord of the Rings Online.  
In Peter Jackson's Lord of the Rings films, Gríma was played by Brad Dourif.  Here, he is depicted as dark-haired, emaciated and eyebrowless, wearing black robes with dark fur, as well as being extremely pale and gaunt (the only detail coming from the book). According to Dourif, Jackson encouraged him to shave off his eyebrows so that the audience would immediately have a subliminal reaction of unease to the character. 
The ""Scouring of the Shire"" episode does not appear in the film version, so the deaths of Saruman and Gríma have been moved to an earlier scene, ""The Voice of Saruman"". This scene was cut from the theatrical releases of the films, but can be found on the Extended Edition DVD of The Return of the King.

    Saruman falling to his death from Orthanc  


    Dying Gríma  
In this scene, the assembled leaders of the West ride to Ent-occupied Isengard to confront Saruman. Théoden offers to forgive Gríma for his treachery, pointing out that he was not always a villain, as he was manipulated by Saruman (as Théoden himself was). Gríma goes to accept the offer, attempting to escape Saruman's cruelty, but Saruman interferes, claiming that Gríma belongs to him forever. When Gríma objects, Saruman slaps him violently to the ground. Enraged at being constantly ill-treated by his enslaver, Gríma rises and stabs Saruman twice in the back with a dagger. Saruman's body then falls from the tower and is impaled on a spiked wheel, a remnant of his war machines, and the Palantír slips out of his cloak. Gríma himself is shot with an arrow fired by Legolas, who had hoped to prevent him from killing Saruman (who was in the process of revealing vital information). He dies of his wound.
Other than the location, the manner of the characters' deaths is very much the same. As in the book, Gríma kills Saruman, not by stabbing him in the back, but slitting his throat (probably because this would have been too graphic for a PG-13 movie), and then shot with an arrow by Legolas (in the book, a hobbit). This scene was to have included a line where Saruman blamed Gríma for killing Théodred; replacing Lotho in the context of that scene, but the line was cut out. However, the line is included in a scene in the The Lord of the Rings: Gameboy Advance version of The Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers after the player defeats Saruman in the Tower of Orthanc.

Ñoldor (House of Fëanor)



Maedhros, also called Maedhros the Tall,[3] was one of the princes of the Ñoldor, the eldest of the seven Sons of Fëanor and head of the House of Fëanor following the death of his father in Middle-earth. He was extraordinarily renowned for his skill both as a warrior and as a diplomat. For hundreds of years, he led his House against the forces of Morgoth but the Oath that he and his six brothers had sworn to recover the Silmarils constrained him and ultimately led to his death.

 Biography 
    Maedhros at the Kinslaying in Alqualonde  
Maedhros was born in Eldamar, probably in Tirion, to Fëanor and Nerdanel sometime during the Noontide of Valinor. After the flight of Fëanor from Tirion in Valinor, he went with his father to Formenos. When Morgoth killed Finwë and stole Fëanor's beloved Silmarils, Maedhros was the first son to take the terrible Oath of Fëanor to recover the holy jewels.[4]
Maedhros participated in the First Kinslaying alongside his father and brothers. He was however the only one of Fëanor's sons not to participate in the burning of the Teleri ships, and in fact advocated for ships and oarsmen to return to Aman to ferry Fingolfin's host.[4] After landing in Middle-earth, the Ñoldor were attacked by an army of Orcs, leading to the Dagor-nuin-Giliath. The Elves were victorious and the remnants of the Orcish army retreated to Angband, pursued by Fëanor and a small vanguard. But Fëanor's force encountered a number of Balrogs as they approached Angband, and were quickly slain. Fëanor himself was dealt a mortal wound by Gothmog, the Lord of the Balrogs, but Maedhros and his brothers arrived with a relief force to rescue him. However, Fëanor died from his wounds shortly thereafter.

    Maedhros captured by Melkor's orcs, by Jenny Dolfen  
Shortly after the Dagor-nuin-Giliath and the death of Fëanor, an embassy came from Morgoth acknowledging defeat, and offering terms which included the possibility of surrendering a Silmaril. Maedhros did not trust Morgoth, and so went to meet his embassy with more men than agreed upon. But Morgoth too had been expecting treachery, and so sent further more troops, including Balrogs. When the two groups met, the Elves were quickly slain and Maedhros was captured. Morgoth then sent word to the Elves that if they forsook their war against him, Maedhros would be released. But the Elves knew that Morgoth would not honor his word and sent no reply. In response, Morgoth bolted Maedhros by the wrist of his right hand to the face of a precipice of Thangorodrim.[5] Shortly thereafter the host of Fingolfin, betrayed by Fëanor and abandoned in Aman, came at last to Middle-earth. The people of Fingolfin, harboring great anger over Fëanor's betrayal, were not welcomed by Fëanor's host for shame, and the two groups remained bitterly divided. But Maedhros's cousin Fingon, with whom he had been very close before the sundering of the Ñoldor, set out to free him, both for the sake of their friendship and in an attempt to heal the division amongst his people.
The recent appearance of the Sun and Moon had prompted Morgoth to blanket the sky above Angband with nigh-impenetrable clouds of ash and smoke to shield his servants. Aided by this darkness and the fact the Morgoth's legions were hiding underground from the newly made lights, Fingon managed to reach Thangorodrim unmolested. But seeing that he could not enter Angband by any means, he began to sing a song in defiance of the Orcs hiding within Angband. Maedhros heard this song, and began to sing with Fingon, and thus Fingon managed to find him upon the slopes of Thangorodrim. But when he reached the foot of the precipice from which Maedhros hung, he found that there was no way to reach Maedhros to free him. Seeing that there was nothing Fingon could do to help him and being in agony without hope of respite, Maedhros begged Fingon to shoot him. Fingon made to do as Maedhros wished, but before he loosed his arrow, he prayed to Manwë to speed the arrow along for Maedhros's sake. Fingon's plea for mercy was heard by Thorondor, the King of Eagles, who stayed Fingon's hand and flew him to Maedhros. But Fingon was unable to either affect the metal band from which Maedhros hung or draw it from the precipice. Maedhros begged Fingon for death once again, but Fingon instead severed Maedhros‘s hand and Thorondor bore them both away from Thangorodrim. Maedhros made a swift recovery, but never forgot his torment, which drove him to become an even deadlier swordsman with his left hand than he had ever been with his right. In gratitude for his rescue, and in atonement for Fëanor's betrayal, Maedhros relinquished all claim as the heir of Finwë and made his Uncle Fingolfin, Fingon's father, High King of the Ñoldor, something his brothers did not take well to. Maedhros openly acknowledged this action as being proper however, as Fingolfin was the oldest living son of Finwë and was therefore next in line for the throne.

    Fingon rescuing Maedhros from one of the Thangorodrim  
Seeing that his brothers were likely to cause feuds with their kinsmen, Maedhros moved them out of Hithlum, and later ruled the lands around the Hill of Himring,[6] which became known as the March of Maedhros. He established there a mighty fortress city not only to separate his rash and fiery brothers from the people of Fingolfin, but because he wished to have any attack from Angband fall first upon him. Allied with Fingolfin, he helped the High King win the battle of Dagor Aglareb. He stood with Fingolfin for nearly 300 years until the Dagor Bragollach, and thanks to his daring deeds during the battle, Himring stood while many other elven realms fell.
Soon after, he learned of Beren and Lúthien's successful quest to liberate a Silmaril from Morgoth's crown. Realizing that Morgoth was not invincible, he took hope and gathered his brothers and united with other Elven Houses to create the Union of Maedhros, hoping to end the dominion of Morgoth forever. However, the Union was utterly broken during the Nirnaeth Arnoediad. Himring was garrisoned by Orcs, and Maedhros and his brothers fled south, taking refuge upon the hill of Amon Ereb.[7]

    Maedhros and Maglor prepared to fight and die after stealing the Silmarils after the War of Wrath  
Several years later, Maedhros and his brothers learned that Elwing of Doriath, granddaughter of Lúthien and Beren, had inherited the Silmaril that her grandparents had recovered from Morgoth. Still driven by the Oath, Maedhros allowed Celegorm to convince him to attack Doriath. During the battle, Celegorm, Caranthir, and Curufin were slain by Beren's son, Dior Eluchil, the King of Doriath, but he himself was slain as well. Dior's sons, Eluréd and Elurín, were captured and abandoned by Celegorm's cruel servants in the forests around Doriath. Maedhros bitterly regretted this deed, and he long searched for the innocent youths but could not find them.[8] After learning that Elwing had survived and had taken the Silmaril with her, he and his surviving brothers descended with an army upon the remnants of the people of Doriath living in the Havens of Sirion. The Ñoldorin princes killed many elves and captured Elwing's sons Elrond and Elros in the sack, but she and her husband Eärendil escaped to the West with the jewel.[9] Heartsick with the burden of the Oath and the deeds he had participated in to see it fulfilled, Maedhros and his brother Maglor took Elwing's sons under their protection.

    Maedhros casts himself in the fiery chasm, by Jenny Dolfen  
After the War of Wrath, he and his last surviving brother, Maglor, demanded the jewels from Eönwë but were denied, as they were judged by the Maia to be unworthy of the jewels due to their cruelty. However, driven onward by the Oath, Maedhros convinced Maglor of the necessity of fulfilling it. As such, one night the two brothers snuck into the camp of the victorious Host of the West, slew the guard around the jewels and laid hands upon them. The camp was roused, and the brothers prepared to die defending their claim. But Eönwë ordered the brothers to be spared, and they left the camp unharmed. But because of the evil deeds committed by the brothers to regain the jewels, they burned in Maglor's and Maedhros' hands. Unable to bear the suffering, Maedhros cast himself and the Silmaril he carried into a fiery chasm in the Earth.[9]


 Etymology 
His father-name was Nelyafinwë (""Finwë the Third""), from the Quenya nelya (""third""),[10] and its shorter form is Nelyo.[2]
His mother Nerdanel called him Maitimo (""Well-shaped one"") for he was ""of beautiful bodily form"". His first epessë was Russandol (""Copper top""), referring to his auburn hair.[2] The second epessë Maedhros is the Sindarin translation of Maitimo and Russandol, from the Sindarin maed (""shapely"") and ross (""red-haired"").[11] The Quenyan Maidhros means ""Pale-glitter"".[12]

 Character 
Maedhros had a fierce spirit, hardened by his torment by Morgoth on Thangorodrim, but was more temperate than his father. He was an exceptionally skilled swordsman despite the loss of his right hand. He was well known for his handsome, comely appearance,[2] especially his auburn hair, which was a contrast with his royal kin's dark hair. He was also known for his skill in diplomacy, as he was able to keep the peace between the House of Fëanor and the rest of his kinsmen for hundreds of years despite the rash and fiery nature of most of his brothers.

Húrin, known also as Húrin Thalion or once Úmarth, was a hero of Men during the First Age. He was the father of the tragic Túrin Turambar. According to The Silmarillion, he was the greatest warrior of Men in the First Age.

 Biography 
 Life in Dor-lómin 
Húrin was a grandson of Hador, of the House of Marach, or House of Hador. Húrin was the elder son of Galdor and Hareth of the Haladin, and he had a younger brother Huor. He was known to be of unimpressive stature, so much so that he could not wear the Dragon-helm of Dor-lómin because it was too large on him to fit properly. Despite this, his prowess in combat surpassed that of all his peers.
In the year FA 458, Huor and Húrin dwelt with their kin in the forest of Brethil, when they joined a war party against Orcs. The brothers ended up in the Vale of Sirion, and were cut off from their company. Chased by orcs, the Vala Ulmo caused a mist to arise from the rivers, and the brothers escaped into Dimbar, there two Great Eagles picked them up, and brought them to Gondolin. King Turgon of Gondolin welcomed the brothers, remembering Ulmo's prophecy that the House of Hador would aid Gondolin in their time of greatest need. Turgon wished them to remain as he grew to love them, but the brothers wished to return to their kin. The brothers swore an oath to keep Gondolin secret, and Eagles brought them back to Dor-Lómin.
In FA 462 Morgoth assailed Hithlum and Húrin's father Galdor the Tall fell defending the Ered Wethrin. Húrin chased the Orcs away with heavy losses over the plains of Anfauglith. Afterwards, Húrin was the Lord of Dor-lómin and ruled over the Hadorian fief of Dor-lómin in Hithlum.

    Húrin and Morwen, by Dakkun39  
Two years later, he wedded Morwen Elf-Sheen of the House of Bëor, and later in the year was born their son Túrin. A daughter Lalaith followed, but she died aged three years old by a plague sent from Angband.

 Nirnaeth Arnoediad 
    Hurin's last stand, by Jenny Dolfen  In FA 473, in the Nírnaeth Arnoediad, Húrin fought alongside Huor and the Sons of Hador. In the midst of battle, he met again with Turgon, and their meeting was sweet. When the battle was lost, Húrin and Huor gathered all the remaining men of the House of Hador and they took a stand fighting off the Orcs, allowing Turgon to escape. Step by step, the army of Morgoth pushed them back. They stepped back until the river Rivil was in front of them, there they did not take one-step back. They kept on fighting until dusk when Huor was slain. In the end, Húrin stood there alone, there he threw his sword and shield on the ground and he took a grand battle-axe of an Orc captain. He waded alone into Gothmog's bodyguard of Trolls, and with every one he slew he yelled with all his voice: ""Aure entuluva!"" (""Day will come again!"") This battle cry was heard seventy times. Húrin fought with the battle axe until the axe itself withered away from the caustic blood of the trolls he had been slaying. He was grappled by the orcs and taken hostage, even though he hewed their limbs off as they grabbed him. Húrin was brought captive to Morgoth, and despite horrific torture, he refused to reveal the location of Gondolin. Due to his defiance, Morgoth cursed him and his family to misery and hopelessness.
Húrin was placed high on the peaks of Thangorodrim, either chained or magically immobilised in a seat where, through the power of Morgoth, he could see all the evils that later befell his son Túrin.[5] He never saw his second daughter Nienor, who was born while he was a captive.

 Release from captivity and death 
In the year FA 500, after the death of his children, Morgoth released Húrin, feigning pity to an utterly defeated foe.[6] In reality however, Morgoth hoped that the bitterness and hate that had been wrought in Húrin throughout his years of watching his family suffer would cause strife and misfortune to those whom Húrin encountered. He was brought to his old homelands in Hithlum, but the Easterlings now living there, under Lorgan, did not recognize him at first, and feared him, believing him to be high in Morgoth's favor. The House of Hador had been destroyed or enslaved. Seven outlaws joined Húrin, and together they went to the vale of Sirion, where he once had known Gondolin. In time Húrin abandoned the outlaws and sought for the entrance, but Gondolin was closed, and the King Turgon at first did not wish to allow him in. Húrin cried out against Turgon, thus inadvertently revealing the general location of Gondolin to Morgoth's spies, and then left. Only after he had left did Turgon have a change of heart, and send Eagles to fetch him, but they came too late and did not find him.

    The Death of Morwen, by Alan Lee  
Húrin continued to the forest of Brethil where his son and daughter had died, and met his wife Morwen there at their grave, minutes before she too passed away. In anger and despair, he sought out the Haladin, blaming them for the death of his wife and children, and after being put on trial caused a revolt in which Hardang, of the house of Haldad, was slain [7]. Húrin met up again with the outlaws, and together with a few of the Haladin, they went to Nargothrond, where Húrin killed the Petty-dwarf Mîm who had claimed the treasure of Glaurung, earning a curse on the gold. Húrin and his outlaws brought the treasure to Doriath, insulting Thingol by giving it as a fee for his 'good care' of Húrin's kin. The outlaws did not accept this, and a bitter battle was fought at Menegroth, leading to the death of all of them, and further cursing the gold. Húrin thus brought a curse on Doriath as well, eventually leading to its downfall.
Melian's kind words managed to break through to Húrin's clouded mind, and Húrin finally saw that all his deeds had only aided Morgoth. A broken man, he finally cast himself in the sea and ended his life.

 Etymology 
In Sindarin, Húrin means ""steadfast"" and Thalion means ""hardened."" Úmarth means ""ill-fate"".[8]

Ñoldor (House of Fëanor)



Maglor was the second son of Fëanor and Nerdanel. He was the greatest poet and minstrel of the Ñoldor and was said to have inherited more of his mother's gentler temperament.
Among the seven brothers, only Maglor, Caranthir, and Curufin were married, but nothing is known of their wives.[1]

 Biography 
    Maglor with his brothers and father swear the Oath of Fëanor  
As with the other Sons of Fëanor, Maglor was bound by an oath to recover his father's Silmarils, which had been stolen by the Dark Lord Morgoth.[2] This oath took the seven brothers to Middle-earth during the First Age where they established realms in exile, waged war against the armies of Morgoth, fought their own Elvish kind, and eventually brought ruin upon themselves.
Maglor took part in the Kinslaying at Alqualondë, and he made the lament Noldolantë, the Fall of the Noldor, in memory of the terrible event.[2]

    Maglor, by Tuuliky  
In Beleriand, Maglor and his brothers followed their father and fought in the Dagor-nuin-Giliath. Fëanor managed to disperse the armies of Morgoth but pressed on to Angband with his sons. Fëanor was mortally wounded and his sons bore his body back to Mithrim. As they drew near Eithel Sirion, Fëanor passed away after cursing Morgoth thrice.[3]
Maglor and his brothers traveled toward the east of Beleriand. Maglor founded the area between the hills surrounding Himring and Blue Mountains, called Maglor's Gap.[4] Years later, the dragon Glaurung passed Maglor's Gap and destroyed the lands about. Maglor and his people fled to Himring to join Maedhros before the Dagor Bragollach took place.[5]
After the Dagor Bragollach, Bór's people came into Beleriand. He and his sons Borlach, Borlad and Borthand swore allegiance to Maedhros and Maglor.[5]
Following the taking of the Silmaril by Beren and Luthien, Maedhros had formed the Union of Maedhros, an alliance between Elves and Men. Under him, Maedhros' host held the east to draw out the army of Angband while Fingon and his host would attack from the west. During the Nirnaeth Arnoediad, Ulfang betrayed the Eldar and Edain. Maglor slew Uldor, son of Ulfang. The Union of Maedhros was broken and though the brethren were all wounded, none were slain. They escaped to Mount Dolmed in the east. After the battle, they took a woodland life in Ossiriand.[6]

    Maglor takes pity on the sons of Eärendil.  
Maglor and his brothers learned when Dior, the new King of Doriath, possessed a Silmaril and refused to give them the jewel that had been won by Beren and worn by Lúthien. In the Sack of Doriath, Maglor's younger brothers Celegorm, Curufin and Caranthir were killed, and the Silmaril was not recovered.[7]

Afterwards, Maglor and his surviving brothers dwelt on Amon Ereb in East Beleriand. Hearing that Elwing, the wife of Eärendil, had escaped from Doriath with the Silmaril and was now living at the Havens of Sirion, the brothers did not act at once, repenting against their destruction of Doriath. But after a time, remembering their oath, they sent messages to the Havens of Sirion that offered friendship while demanding that the Silmaril be returned to them. And when these demands were refused, they mounted an attack on the Havens with their remaining followers, thus perpetrating the Third Kinslaying that resulted from the accursed Oath of Fëanor.    Maglor casts his Silmaril into the sea  
Although they won the fight, after spilling much of their kin's blood, they did not obtain the Silmaril for Elwing escaped over the Great Sea with it. After the carnage of the cruel bloodletting, Maglor and his brother Maedhros came upon the two young sons of Eärendil and Elwing, Elrond and Elros. With so much blood already on his hands, Maglor took pity on them and would not allow them to be slain. So, in the absence of their parents, he took them into his household and raised them as if they were his own children.[8]    Maglor by the sea, by Filat  
After the War of Wrath, Maglor and his last surviving brother Maedhros stole the two remaining Silmarils taken by the Valar from Morgoth, even though initially Maglor tried to dissuade his older brother from doing this. But because of the evil deeds committed by the brothers to regain the jewels, they burned in Maglor and Maedhros's hands. Unable to bear the suffering, Maglor cast his Silmaril into the sea. Thereafter, he wandered along the shores of the world singing laments over the loss of the Silmaril, until he faded from memory,[8] though the circumstances and date of his death, if it ever happened at all, are unknown.

 Etymology 
His father-name was Kanafinwë, which meant ""Strong-voiced Finwë"" or ""Commanding Finwë"" from kano (""commanding"").[9][10] His mother-name was Macalaurë, meaning ""Gold-cleaver"" from Quenya words mak (""cleave"") and laurë (""gold"") [11][9], possibly alluding to the power of his voice. Maglor is a Sindarin rendering of his Quenya mother-name.

 Other Names 
Maglor's Old English name is Daegmund Swinsere. Christopher Tolkien cannot explain the origin of the name Daegmund, but the Old English mund means ""hand"" and ""protection"". The word Swinsere means ""musician"" or ""singer"".[12]

Celebrían (IPA: [keleˈbriːan]) was an Elven noblewoman, the daughter of Celeborn and Galadriel, wife of Elrond, and mother of Elrohir, Elladan and Arwen.

Contents[show]
 Biography 
Celebrían's birth date is unspecified, though she may have been born near Lake Evendim between SA 350 and SA 400. She lived with her mother Galadriel in Eregion, and later fled to Lórinand sometime between SA 1350 and SA 1400. After a time, Galadriel and Celebrían passed through Moria and dwelt in Rivendell. There, she met Elrond, who, though he loved her, said nothing about it.[2]
In TA 109, Elrond wedded Celebrían. She bore him twin sons, Elladan and Elrohir in TA 130, and then a daughter, Arwen in TA 241.[1][2]
In TA 2509, Celebrían was on her way to visit her parents in Lothlórien when she was waylaid by Orcs in the Redhorn Pass of the Misty Mountains. She was then tormented by the orcs and received a poisoned wound. Her sons arrived much later to rescue her, and Elrond to heal her, but Celebrían was never fully-healed in mind and spirit. Horrified and haunted by the memories of her torture, she no longer desired to remain on Middle-earth, and sailed west the next year.[1] Elladan and Elrohir never forgot or forgave their mother's torment, and frequently rode with Aragorn and the Rangers of the North, striking back at the orcs and other servants of Sauron whenever possible.

 Later mentions 
There are several references of Celebrían in The Lord of the Rings, such as the mention of her torment[3] and being the daughter of Galadriel.[4]

 Etymology 
The name Celebrían means ""Silver queen""[5], from the Sindarin words celeb (""silver"") and rían (""queen"").[6]

Culture
Ñoldor (House of Fëanor)



Caranthir, also known as Caranthir the Dark,[4] was the fourth son of Fëanor and the harshest and the quickest to anger of his seven brothers.[5]

Contents[show]
 Biography 
As with his brothers, Caranthir was bound by an oath to recover his father's Silmarils, which had been stolen by the Dark Lord Morgoth in Aman. This oath took the seven brothers to Middle-earth during the First Age where they established realms in exile, waged war against the armies of Morgoth, fought their own Elvish kind, and eventually brought ruin upon themselves.[6]
Caranthir's realm was in Thargelion in the East Beleriand, and was sometimes called Dor Caranthir (Caranthir's land); his abode was on the shores of Lake Helevorn.[7] Because his realm bordered the great Dwarfish Kingdoms of Nogrod and Belegost in the Blue Mountains, he became very wealthy probably controlling much of the trade coming through the Dwarf-Road.

    Caranthir meets Haleth  
He rescued the Edain lady Haleth and her people, the Haladin, as they were besieged by Orcs. He then saw the bravery and valour of Men, and offered the Haladin settlement in the North, but Haleth, thanking him, refused and left, eventually settling in the Brethil.[8]
In FA 455, after the Dagor Bragollach, Caranthir was forced to flee Thargelion and headed south with his brother Amrod. Two years later, the sons of Ulfang, Uldor, Ulfast and Ulwarth swore allegiance to Caranthir[9] but were faithless later in the Nirnaeth Arnoediad.[10]
Caranthir, along with his brothers Celegorm and Curufin, perished during the Second Kinslaying in Menegroth to recover the Silmarils from Elven King Dior of Doriath.[11]

Etymology
Caranthir is the Sindarin translation of his mother-name Carnistir (""Red-face"") from the Quenya carnë (""red, scarlet"").[12] His father-name is Morifinwë (""Dark Finwë"")[2] from mor (""Dark"").[12]

 Other versions of the legendarium 
In the earlier versions, Caranthir was called Cranthor [13] and Cranthir.

Dúnedain of the North (House of Isildur)



Arvedui was the fifteenth and last King of Arthedain.
Contents[show]
 Biography 
Arvedui was the son of King Araphant, and came to the throne in TA 1964 at the death of his father. Arvedui married Fíriel, daughter of King Ondoher of Gondor, who was killed in TA 1944. At Ondoher's death, Arvedui sent messages to Gondor claiming the throne as a direct descendant of Isildur, but he was refused: the Men of Gondor appointed general Eärnil as King instead. Arvedui became King of Arthedain soon after, and in TA 1974 Angmar attacked again, driving the Dúnedain away. Gondor sent help in the form of a great fleet, but it came too late: Arthedain was destroyed, and Arvedui fled to the Icebay of Forochel.
Círdan of Lindon sent a ship north to rescue him, and, against the advice of the Snowmen of Forochel, Arvedui boarded it and was drowned.

    Arvedui's ship, frozen in the ice of Forochel.  
An army from Gondor under Eärnur managed to destroy Angmar with help of Círdan, but Arthedain and all of Arnor were no more, and the kingship had ended. Arvedui died in TA 1975 after ruling for eleven years and his son Aranarth became the first of the Chieftains of the Dúnedain.[1]
Thus the prophecy became the truth, for Arvedui was indeed the last King of Arnor, and likewise the line of the Kings of Gondor also ended with Earnil's son Eärnur. The realms were not reunited until over a thousand years later, when Aragorn became King Elessar. Arvedui's claim was never forgotten by his descendants, though it would be centuries before Aragorn invoked the claim.[2]

 Etymology 
Arvedui means ""Last King"", from the Sindarin words ar(a) (""king, high, noble"") and medui or later vedui (""last"").[3] He was named so because of a prophesy by Malbeth the Seer.[4]

Edain (House of Bëor)Men of Dorthonion



Barahir was an Edain Man of Dorthonion during the First Age, heir to the House of Bëor, youngest son and last child of Bregor, the fifth chieftain of the People of Bëor, and husband of Emeldir who was also of the House of Bëor through the line of Belen, the youngest son of Bëor. Barahir was most famous for being the father of the renowned Beren Erchamion. He was also the fourth Lord of Ladros and the seventh and probably last Chieftain of the Bëorians after his deceased elder brother Bregolas.[2][3] Besides his elder brother, Barahir had three elder sisters: Bregil, Hirwen, and Gilwen.[4]

Contents[show]
 Biography 
Earlier, Barahir had fought at the Dagor Bragollach, saving Finrod Felagund's life earning him and his house the friendship of the House of Finarfin. For this, he received ""Barahir's Ring"", which was then handed down the family line. After the Dagor Bragollach by FA 456[1], Barahir lived with twelve companions on the highland of Dorthonion at Tarn Aeluin as outlaws defying the will of Morgoth whose forces hunted him and his company like wild beasts.[5] The members of Barahir's outlaw band was his son Beren, his nephews Baragund the elder and Belegund the younger, Radhruin and Dairuin, Dagnir and Ragnor, Gildor and Gorlim the Unhappy, Arthad, and Urthel, and Hathaldir the Young. As for his wife Emeldir, she parted from Barahir when she became the leader of the women and children of Bëor's folk that fled Dorthonion. For her bravery in this, Barahir's wife was known as Emeldir the Man-hearted,
For five years, Barahir led his doomed band of outlaws until FA 460 when they were betrayed to Sauron by Gorlim, a lovesick member of Barahir's outlaw band and Barahir was killed at Tarn Aeluin along with everyone in his company save for Beren his son who was gone on an errand for them and thus luckily happened to be not there. Barahir's remains were buried in a cairn by his son at Tarn Aeluin save for his hand which was chopped off by an Orc captain of Morgoth. Beren later slew that Orc-captain and recovered the renowned Ring of Barahir. Barahir's son then escaped Dorthonion after all and lived on to fulfill a great destiny.[6]

 Legacy 
Barahir's service to Finrod and House of Finarfin left behind a legacy of respect between the House of Bëor, later generations of Men, and Elves. This friendship led to the close association of the elves and the Dúnedain of Númenor and Arnor and Gondor. His ring also became an heirloom of the Dúnedain of the North of Middle-earth.

 Later namesakes 
Barahir was also the name of the eighth Steward of Gondor and was also the name of the grandson of Faramir and Éowyn in the Fourth Age, who wrote The Tale of Aragorn and Arwen.

 Behind the scenes 
The character of Barahir evolved out of the character Egnor bo-Rimion (see The Book of Lost Tales and Beren and Lúthien novel). In the original Barahir was originally a Gnome, an Elf. The Tale of Tinúviel saw a 1925 (and later) edit that changed Egnor into Barahir a Noldoli Elf. At some point the character evolved into a Man. However, its noted in 'Beren and Luthien that the in the original pre-1917 transcript which J.R.R. Tolkien erased and wrote over that Beren was originally a Man, before he rewrote the character as an Elf, and would go back to making him a Man in Lay of Leithian (though the narrative included in the new novel has Beren switching between both races depending on the section documents).

Amras, along with his twin brother Amrod, were the youngest sons of Fëanor. Through their mother Nerdanel, they inherited red hair (probably a dark red), instead of Fëanor's black.

Contents[show]
 Biography 
Amras was the younger twin brother of Amrod, thus the youngest of the Sons of Fëanor.[4] He was probably born sometime during the Years of the Trees. Along with his father and brothers, he followed the Ñoldor into exile.[5] His mother Nerdanel once asked Fëanor to leave Amrod and Amras, or at least one of them, but Fëanor did not listen. Nerdanel prophesied that not all his sons would set foot on Middle-earth.[6]
At the dawn of the Burning of the ships at Losgar, Amras noticed the absence of his twin brother Amrod. He explained that Amrod was restless and did not sleep on the ground out of discomfort. He was the last to speak about this matter to Fëanor.[6]
Later, Amras and his brothers rescued their father who died afterward from Dagor-nuin-Giliath.[7] He became a hunter in Middle-earth and held the southern lands of Estolad in the East Beleriand between the rivers Gelion, Celon, and the Andram behind the March of Maedhros.[8][9]
Amras took part in the final two Kinslayings, and eventually fell during the Third Kinslaying at the Havens of Sirion in FA 538.[10]

 Etymology 
Amras is a Sindarin word.[11] His father-name is Pityafinwë ""Little Finwë"", from pitya (""little""). Its shorter form was Pityo. His mother-name was Ambarussa ""Top-russet"", the name he and his brother called each other.[6]

 Earlier Names 
Amras was called Diriel in earlier writings.[12]

 Other Names 
Like the rest of his brothers, Amras was given an Old English name. He was called Tirgeld, from the words tir (""glory"") and geld (""of worth"").[13]

Culture
Ñoldor (House of Fingolfin)



Anairë was an Elf of Valinor and the wife of Fingolfin.

Contents[show]
 Biography 
Little is known of Anairë's life; only that she chose not to follow her husband to Middle-earth during their departure from Aman. They had four children during the Noontide of Valinor, namely Fingon, Turgon, Aredhel, and Argon. Anairë was known to be friends with Eärwen, Finarfin's wife.[1] It is assumed that she continued to reside in Aman along with the other Elves of Valinor.

    Anairë awaiting her husband in Aman, by Filat  
 Etymology 
In Quenya, Anairë means Holiest, from airë (""holy"") and an-, a superlative prefix.[1]

 Other versions of the legendarium 
Anairë does not appear in the The Silmarillion; Fingolfin has three children, but the wife is unspecified.
In an early manuscript, her name was spelled as ""Alaire"". In another, she was identified as a Vanya who remained in Túna, who would later be Elenwë, Turgon's wife.[2]

Aredhel, also known as Aredhel Ar-Feiniel,[2] the ""White Lady of the Ñoldor"", was the only daughter and third child of the Noldorin High-prince Fingolfin and his wife Anairë. Aredhel was the sister of  Fingon, Turgon and Argon, and the mother of Maeglin.

Contents[show]
 Biography 
    Aredhel Ar-Feiniel dressed in white and silver in the forest of Nan Elmoth, by Filat  
Aredhel was born in YT 1362, the same year as her cousin Galadriel,[1] and lived in Tirion. She followed her father and brothers through Helcaraxë and dwelt in Nevrast with her brother Turgon until Gondolin was complete, and when it was she went with him to the hidden city. But after two hundred years, the longing for the forests and wide lands overcame her, and she asked leave to depart. Turgon was unwilling, fearing the exposure of the Hidden Kingdom, but eventually relented and allowed her to leave.
Riding with companions Glorfindel, Ecthelion, and Egalmoth,[3] they were denied entrance to Doriath, it being closed to the Ñoldor. But they did tell her of the best way to find the Sons of Fëanor, and so they went around to the north, where she was separated in the dangerous region of Nan Dungortheb and reported lost. However, she reached Himlad safely, and waited there to meet Celegorm who was abroad, but eventually she wandered out of boredom and became lost in the forest of Nan Elmoth.

    Eöl welcomes Aredhel, by Ted Nasmith  
Eöl the Dark Elf ruled those woods; seeing Aredhel and noticing her beauty, he set enchantments about her so that she could not escape the forest. Eventually, she wandered to Eöl's dwelling in the woods, where he finally revealed himself to her. After marrying him, she stayed with him many years. They had a son named Maeglin, and telling him of her former life and home, she desired to see them again, and left Nan Elmoth with Maeglin while Eöl was away. They reached Gondolin (not realizing that Eöl was following them all the while), and were received with rejoicing. Eöl was also discovered and brought before Turgon, but rather than accept Turgon's judgment to remain, he attempted to kill his son for disobeying him with a poisoned javelin concealed in his cloak. Aredhel stepped in front of it and was hit by it and because of its poison, she died that night from the wound.
Eöl was cast down from the city walls and died, while Maeglin became mighty in Gondolin but later betrayed it to Morgoth.[4][5]

 Etymology 
Her name in Quenya was Irissë.[6] The names Aredhel (""noble elf"")[7] and Ar-Feiniel (""noble white lady"") were both originally intended to stand alone, and be used as the main name of Irissë.
While preparing The Silmarillion for publication Christopher Tolkien could not discover which name was intended to be used as her final name, and he therefore chose to use both names: a decision he later stated in The History of Middle-earth series was possibly mistaken.

 Character 
Aredhel was tall and strong, fond of hunting and riding in the forests. Her skin was pale and her hair dark; she always wore silver and white. Though fond of the Sons of Fëanor, she never fell in love with any of them.[2]

Nerdanel, also known as Nerdanel the Wise, was the daughter of the Ñoldorin smith Mahtan and the wife of the infamous Fëanor the High Prince of the Noldor, eldest son of Finwë.

Contents[show]
 Biography 
    Nerdanel with her sons Maedhros, Maglor, Celegorm, Caranthir, Curufin (unborn), by Jenny Dolfen   After marrying Fëanor, Nerdanel bore him seven sons: Maedhros, Maglor, Celegorm, Caranthir, Curufin, Amrod and Amras.
    Nerdanel, with father Mahtan and future husband Feanor  Unlike her husband, she was of a peaceful nature and sought to moderate his fiery temper and pride with wisdom. For a time, she was the only one able to influence him.[1]
Nerdanel refused to follow her husband to Middle-earth and their parting was not a happy one. When it became clear that he intended to leave Valinor for good, she came to him and pleaded with him to let her youngest sons, Amrod and Amras to remain with her. Fëanor would hear nothing of it and accused her of being against him and in league with the Valar, namely Aulë saying that they wished to follow and obey their father and if she did not follow him she would be abandoning all of their children. She then scorned him saying that he would not have them all and then she left, possibly retiring to her father's house in Aman.[2] By refusing to join her husband in revolt, Nerdanel herself avoided the Doom of Mandos, but her sons did not. The last remnant of her family survived through her grandson Celebrimbor, the forger of the three Elven Rings of Power.

 Attributes 
 Nerdanel was a sculptor of great note and is said to have made deceptively lifelike statues.
During the earlier times of Nerdanel's marriage to Fëanor, her father Mahtan, a Noldorin smith among those of the Noldor who was in service to Aulë, tutored his daughter Nerdanel's husband Fëanor in the making of things in metal and in stone.

Sam and Matt Kennard (Born of Hope)



Elladan and Elrohir were the twin sons of Elrond the Half-elven and Celebrían of Rivendell, and were noted for their close friendship and cooperation with the Dúnedain of the North, Rangers of the North and Men in general, and for their deeds during the War of the Ring.
Contents[show]
 Biography 
 Third Age 
    Elladan  Elladan and Elrohir were born in TA 130,[3] and had a younger sister, Arwen. Through their mother Celebrían, they were the only grandsons of Lady Galadriel and Lord Celeborn of Lothlórien.
In TA 2509, the brothers rescued their mother from her imprisonment with the Orcs. Although she was physically healed by Elrond, after fear and torment from the Orcs she lost all joy from Middle-earth, and so she departed for the Grey Havens the next year. Due to this, the twins harbored great hatred for Orcs.[4]
By the year TA 2933, Elladan and Elrohir went riding against Orcs with Arathorn II, the father of Aragorn. There Arathorn was slain and his wife and son went to dwell in Imladris, where Elrond received Aragorn as his foster-son, naming him Estel.[5]

 War of the Ring 
When the Fellowship arrived in Rivendell, the twins' role was to scout the lands and prepare the way for the Fellowship.[6] Later, they traveled along with Halbarad and the Grey Company. They delivered a message from their father concerning the Paths of the Dead and followed Aragorn, Legolas and Gimli there. Elladan traveled behind the company, the Dead following after him.[2] They battled in the Fields of Pelennor ""with stars bound to their brows.""[7]
During the last council, Elladan and Elrohir seconded Mithrandir's decision to throw the remaining troops of Gondor and Rohan at the Morannon, saying that Elrond had sent them with that same counsel from Rivendell.[8] Elladan and Elrohir also accompanied Aragorn and fought alongside him at the Black Gate.

 After the War 
After the war, Elladan and Elrohir met the escort of Arwen in Lothlorien, and together, they traveled to Edoras.[9] The brothers arrived first and carried a banner of silver. They were followed by Glorfindel and Erestor.[10]

 Fourth Age and beyond 
When their father departed to the West, the brothers stayed in Rivendell for a while. In time, their grandfather Celeborn came to live with them before passing into the Grey Havens.[11] It is unknown whether Elladan and Elrohir chose to remain in Middle-earth as mortal men or depart with the last of their kindred to Valinor.

 Etymology 
The name Elladan is Sindarin for ""Elf-Man"" or ""Elf-Dúnadan,"" referring to his dual descent from both Elves and Edain (a name given to those descending from the three houses of Men from Beleriand).[12] It comes from the words el (""elf or star"") and adan, singular of Edain.[13] On the other hand, Elrohir means ""Elf-knight"", but rochir also means ""horse-lord"".[14]

 Character 
    Elrohir, by Magali Villeneuve  
    Elladan, by Magali Villeneuve  
Though Tolkien never specifically states that Elrohir and Elladan were twins, it is suspected that they were for four reasons: first, they are described as ""So much alike were they, the sons of Elrond, that few could tell them apart: dark-haired, grey-eyed, and their faces elven-fair, clad alike in bright mail beneath cloaks of silver-grey"" (Tolkien 761).[2] Secondly, one is rarely mentioned without the other, and their names are only separated when they are speaking. Thirdly, they were both born in the same year,[3] and elven pregnancies last a full year.[note 1] Fourthly, the birth of twins was not a rare occurrence in their family history (Amrod and Amras, Eluréd and Elurín, Elrond and Elros).
The brethren were friends and companions-in-arms of the Rangers of the North, and helped defend the remnants of Arnor from evil after the fall of the northern kingdom. They held a special grudge against orcs because of their mother's suffering at their hands.
Like their sister, father, and uncle, they could make a choice between mortality and immortality, expressed by whether they would follow their father to Valinor at the time of his own departure at the end of the Third Age. Since they are explicitly described as remaining in Rivendell for a time after their father's departure, some fans speculated that they had also chosen mortality. However, J.R.R. Tolkien himself noted that the twins were allowed to ""delay"" their choices.[15]

Contents[show]
 Biography 
    Aegnor first meets Andreth, by Szilvia Szarvas  
Aegnor was born in Tirion sometime during the Noontide of Valinor.[3] When Fëanor spoke in Tirion, Aegnor was moved by his words as was his brother but neither spoke against their father; however, he and his brothers followed the host of the Ñoldor to Middle-earth.[4] When the Ñoldor returned to Middle-earth, he together with Angrod held the northern slopes of the highlands of Dorthonion against Morgoth throughout the time of the Siege of Angband.[5]
Aegnor never married but he was in love with the Bëorian wise-woman Andreth, and she returned his feelings. They spent much time discussing Men and Elves and their fates in the world, which are fully explained in the Athrabeth Finrod ah Andreth. However, it was wartime and he did not make his intentions towards her clear enough. He was killed along with his brother soon after when Morgoth broke the Siege at the start of Dagor Bragollach in FA 455.[2]

    Aegnor with his love, Andreth, by Filat  
Etymology
The name Aegnor is a Sindarin form of his Quenya name Aikanár or Aikanáro, meaning ""Sharp Flame"" or ""Fell Fire"".[6]

Andreth was an Edain of the House of Bëor. She was the second child and only daughter of Boromir and the sister of Bregor her elder brother and Beril her younger brother.

Contents[show]
Biography
    Andreth first meets Aegnor, by Szilvia Szarvas  
Andreth was born in Ladros in Dorthonion. She was wise in thought and learned in the lore of Men and thus was called Saelind (Wise-heart) by the Elves of her time. In her earlier life she lived in the house of Belemir in Ladros, where she had learned the lore of the House of Marach from Adanel.
Andreth was deeply in love with Aegnor, son of Finarfin. The love was returned but never fulfilled, since Aegnor departed from motives of wisdom as he felt his coming death, thus they never married and had no children. She had a close friendship with Aegnor's brother Finrod Felagund, who often visited her during the Siege of Angband to converse and debate with her on the matters of Elves and Men. One such conversation was written down and later known as Athrabeth Finrod ah Andreth, where she and Finrod discussed differences between Elves and Men.

    Andreth with her love Aegnor by the shore of Lake Aeluin, by Szilvia Szarvas  
She probably died when Morgoth broke the Siege of Angband in Dagor Bragollach in FA 455 of causes unknown.[3] She was the only known person of Mankind to have had a romantic relationship with someone of Elvenkind before Beren.

Etymology
The name Andreth was a Sindarin word that meant ""patience"". The first element of her name may have come from the word and, meaning ""long"", possibly alluding to a meaning such as ""long lasting"", although the second element reth is more difficult to decipher and appears to have no immediate explanation.
As said, Andreth was also known as Saelind, meaning ""wise heart"", which comes from the Sindarin words sael, meaning 'wise', and ind, meaning ""inner thought"" or ""heart"".

 Other accounts 
Andreth had once prophesied that Túrin would return from the dead in the last days to fight in the Last Battle against Morgoth and the dark forces.[4]

 Earlier names 
Saelon and Saelin were two names Tolkien came up with that preceded Saelind.[5]

Eärwen was the daughter of Olwë and had several unnamed brothers. She was the wife of Finarfin, and mother of Finrod, Angrod, Aegnor, and Galadriel.[2]

Contents[show]
 Biography 
Eärwen was born during the Years of the Trees either in Middle-earth or in the Elven realms of the Far West, possibly Tol Eressëa or Alqualondë. In YT 1280, she wedded Finarfin the youngest son of Finwë.[3] Her children were Finrod, Angrod, Aegnor, and Galadriel. She was said to be a friend of Anairë, wife of Fingolfin.[4]
Like Anairë, Eärwen did not follow her husband into exile during the Revolt of the Ñoldor.[4] Later, Finarfin repented because of the Kinslaying at Alqualondë and returned to Aman.[5]

 Etymology 
The name Eärwen means ""Sea-maiden"" from the Quenyan ëar (""Sea"") and the sufix -wen (""maiden"").[6][7][8]

Morwen was an Adan of the House of Bëor, the daughter of Baragund and the wife of Húrin Thalion and the mother of Túrin Turambar.[1]
Morwen was tall, dark-haired and beautiful to where people called her Eledhwen, the elven-fair and at times very proud and stern and spoke little, traits which she passed on to her son Túrin.

Contents[show]
Biography
Morwen was born in Ladros in the northeast of Dorthonion to Baragund and an unnamed wife. She married Húrin of the House of Marach. After Dagor Bragollach, she and her folk moved northeast through the Ered Wethrin and after enduring great losses and finally came to Dor-lómin in Hithlum and were well received by the folk there. It was here that she and her husband had their three children, Túrin, Niënor Níniel, and Lalaith.[2]

    Morwen with her son Túrin, by Filat  
Húrin went off to fight in the Nirnaeth Arnoediad but never returned as the battle was lost. After the defeat of the Union of Maedhros, the savage Easterlings came to Hithlum to claim their new land as a reward for fighting for the Dark Lord. The Easterlings were cruel and took many slaves including the young and old. Morwen resisted the new Easterling lords that took over Húrin's land, and sent Túrin away to Doriath and the court of King Thingol, to prevent him from being taken as a slave. However, none of the Easterlings dared take Morwen's home, for they believed she was a witch and in league with elves, although she had no such power.[3] After most of the danger had passed, she went to Doriath looking for Túrin. Niënor followed her against her commands, but she was accepted by Thingol.[2][4]
Morwen was alarmed at not finding her son in Doriath, and after staying for a while she and Mablung left to search for Túrin. Niënor followed against Morwen's will for a second time. While they sought for Túrin in the forest, Glaurung the dragon came upon them. He gave Niënor amnesia with his dragon magic and left. When Mablung found Niënor, she ran off into the woods, and was not seen by Morwen again. Morwen returned to Doriath after this sad incident.[2][4]

    The Death of Morwen, by Alan Lee  
Morwen met her husband Húrin once again after the death of Túrin and Niënor. At their children's grave Húrin found Morwen, ragged, tired, and sorrowful. They spoke their last words together, and then Morwen died with the setting of the sun and was buried with her children.[5][6]
Their graves remained after the drowning of the Beleriand at the end of the First Age on the isle of Tol Morwen off the coast of Forlindon, which was no doubt named after her.[7]

Etymology
The name Morwen is Sindarin for ""Dark Maiden"", from mor (""dark"") and -gwenn or -wen (""maiden""). Her epithet Eledhwen means ""Elf-maiden"", from eledh (""elf"").[8] Eledhwen is interpreted as ""Elfsheen"".[9]

Earlier versions of the legendarium
In earlier stages of the legendarium, Éowyn of Rohan had been referred to sometimes as ""Éowyn Elfsheen, daughter of Théoden"".[10]

House of Hador


The House of Hador was previously known as the House of Marach.

Vanyar (Elves of Valinor)



Elenwë was a Vanyarin elf, the wife of Turgon and the mother of Idril, to whom she passed on the golden hair of her kindred.

Contents[show]
 Biography 
Elenwë was probably born in Valinor sometime during the Noontide of Valinor. Elenwë followed her husband to Middle-earth when his brethren resolved to join the House of Fëanor in pursuit of Melkor and regain the Silmarils. Unfortunately, she along with many others died during the crossing of Helcaraxë, while Turgon almost perished himself trying to save her.[2][3] It was said that her body was covered in ice and was therefore unable to be saved.[4]
She was the only known Vanyar elf to have ever left Valinor and after her death her bloodline survived through her grandson Eärendil, her great-grandsons Elrond and Elros, onward into the royal Númenor-line. Her other descendants included Arwen and her brothers Elladan and Elrohir.

 Etymology 
Elenwë means ""Star person"" in Quenya from elen (""star"")[5] and the prefix -wë (""person"").[6]

 Other versions in the legendarium 
The earlier name for Elenwë was Alairë (later Anairë). However, Tolkien corrected this and made Anairë Fingolfin's spouse and Turgon's mother.[7]

Dior, also called Dior Eluchîl, was the son Beren the One-handed of the House of Bëor (First House of the Edain) and the Elven-princess Lúthien of Doriath. He later became the King of Doriath as the heir of King Thingol, and thus became the High King of the Sindar. Dior the Fair was one of the Half-elven for his father was of the race of Men, and his mother was Elven.

Contents[show]
 Biography 
Dior was born in the First Age on Tol Galen in the East Beleriand.[3]  He later moved to Lanthir Lamath where he married princess Nimloth of Doriath.  Nimloth was the daughter of prince Galathil of Doriath who was the brother of Celeborn. Dior and Nimloth had three children: two sons Eluréd and Elurín, and one daughter Elwing.[4]
After Thingol was slain by the dwarves who coveted the Nauglamir, Dior became King of Doriath as Thingol's only heir-apparent. In Doriath, King Dior and his wife Queen Nimloth lived peacefully for several years until the Sons of Fëanor learned he inherited the Silmaril that was previously kept by his parents. After Dior rejected their claim to the Silmaril, the Sons of Fëanor declared war on Doriath.[4]
Dior and Nimloth were slain during the Sack of Menegroth, but he also killed Celegorm, Curufin, and Caranthir. In revenge, the servants of Celegorm captured Eluréd and Elurín, and abandoned the young children to die in the woods of Doriath. Elwing, however, escaped with a remnant of the Elves of Doriath to the Havens of Sirion, where she wedded Eärendil the Mariner, and they together sought pardon and aid from the Valar.[5]
Dior was one of the fairest beings to ever live, a product of three different heritages (races): Ainur (Maiar), Men, and Elves.[6] His paternal grandparents were Barahir (a great chieftain of the Edain) and Emeldir the Man-hearted. His maternal grandparents were King Thingol and Melian the Maia.

 Etymology 
Dior probably means ""successor"". He was also called Eluchíl which means ""Heir of Elu"",[7] Ausir which means ""the Wealthy"",[8] and Aranel which means ""Noble Elf"" or ""King of Elves"".[7]

Eluréd and Elurín were the twin sons of Dior Eluchîl, son of Beren and Lúthien, and Dior's Elven wife, Nimloth.

Contents[show]
 Biography 
Eluréd and Elurín were both born in the short-lived renewed Kingdom of Doriath under their father Dior. They were named after their great-grandfather Elu Thingol, the King of Doriath. They had a younger sister named Elwing.[2]
The boys lived peacefully with their father and mother in Menegroth until the dreaded Oath of Fëanor descended on Doriath due to Dior's failure to turn over the Silmaril, under the threat of war. When the Sons of Fëanor attacked, the twins were seized by the cruel servants of Celegorm and abandoned in the forest to die. However, Maedhros, the eldest of the Sons of Fëanor, bitterly regretted this deed and sought in vain for them in the surrounding forest.[2]
They were never found and were presumed to have perished in the forest. Tradition among the Nandor of Ossiriand held that they were led to the safety of the woodlands by birds and beasts and survived.[2]

 Etymology 
The name Elurín was a Sindarin word that means ""Remembrance of Elu"", which came from the words Elu, which was another name for Thingol, and ren (""recall, have in mind"").[3]
Eluréd has less clear origins. The latter element réd  may have come from the Bëorian word rêda (""heir"").[3]

 Earlier names 
Eluréd and Elurín were initially called Eldún and Elrún.[3] In other writings, they were given the name Elboron and Elbereth. These names were also the earlier names for the sons of Elrond, Elladan and Elrohir.[4]

Tar-Elendil was the fourth King of Númenor, succeeding his father Tar-Amandil. He was considered to be a master of lore and a notable scholar.

Contents[show]
 Biography 
His oldest child was Silmariën, a daughter, and his second child was Isilmë, another daughter. Silmariën would have become Queen according to the principle of ""full cognatic primogeniture"". However, the laws dictating succession at the time followed rather the principle known as ""agnatic primogeniture"", preventing women from ruling. Consequently, his third child and oldest son Tar-Meneldur succeeded him.[1]
Tar-Elendil was the direct ancestor of all subsequent Kings of Númenor through his son. From the time of the reign of Tar-Elendil, Númenóreans began to contact with the Middle-earth more actively. It was in SA 600 that Vëantur, the Captain of the King's Ships, sailed from Númenor to the Middle-earth for the first time. He surrendered the Sceptre in SA 740 and died in year 751 of the Second Age, at the age of 401 years.[1]

Etymology

Valandil founded the line of the Lords of Andúnië in the western region of Andustar on Númenor.

Contents[show]
 Biography 
Valandil's father was Elatan of Andúnië, and his mother was Silmariën, the eldest child of Tar-Elendil of Númenor. The laws of Númenor at that time would not allow Silmariën to rule as queen, so Valandil and subsequent Lords of Andúnië were not in line for royal succession.
By the end of the Second Age however, Valadil's descendants would become kings in Middle-earth, beginning with Elendil, the last Lord of Andúnië and first Dúnedain King of Gondor.
Valandil was also the name of the youngest son of Isildur and the grandson of Elendil who eventually became King of Arnor.

 Etymology 
Valandil means ""Devoted to the Valar"" from Vala and -ndil (""friend, devoted to"") in Quenya.[1]

Tar-Ancalimë was the seventh ruler of Númenor and the first Ruling Queen .

Contents[show]
 Biography 
Tar-Ancalimë was raised by her mother Erendis, and her childhood companion was Zamîn. Her mother's tragic marriage to Tar-Aldarion might have influenced Tar-Ancalimë's rejection of her husband.
She moved to the Númenórean sheep-lands of Emerië where her mother had a house to escape from the many suitors who sought her hand in marriage. There she dwelt for a time, tending sheep, and assuming the name Emerwen Aranel.
She married the nobleman Hallacar, son of Hallatan of Hyarastorni in SA 1000. Both Tar-Ancalimë and Hallacar were fifth-generation descendants of King Vardamir Nólimon, and the marriage was more one of politics than of love. The Queen aimed to produce an heir in order to secure her throne from her first cousin Soronto. Following the birth of their son, Hallacar and Tar-Ancalimë lived separately.
She was succeeded by her son, Tar-Anárion. She died in year 1285 of the Second Age after a rule of 205 years, at the age of 412 years.[1][2]

 Etymology 
Ancalimë means ""Most bright"" and Emerwen Aranel means ""Princess Shepherdess"" in Quenya.[citation needed]","

Tar-Telperiën was the tenth ruler and second Ruling Queen of Númenor. She succeeded her father, King Tar-Súrion (who was King because his two elder sisters had no interest in ruling).

Contents[show]
 Biography 
Tar-Telperiën ruled for 175 years. During her reign, the Rings of Power were forged, and Sauron conquered Eriador. She did little to react to these events. She refused to marry and bore no children. She was succeeded by Tar-Minastir, the son of her younger brother, Isilmo. She died in year SA 1731 at the age of 411 years.[1]

 Etymology 
Her name might be related to the Quenya tyelpë (""silver"") and -ien, a feminine suffix.[2]
She was most likely named after Telperion, the White Tree of Valinor.

Tar-Vanimeldë was the sixteenth ruler of Númenor and third and last ruling Queen of Númenor.[1]

Contents[show]
Biography
Tar-Vanimeldë was the daughter and heir of Tar-Telemmaitë. She had little interest in ruling, loving rather culture and the arts such as music and dance, however, and left the day-to-day chores of monarchy to her husband, the nobleman Herucalmo.
Tar-Vanimeldë ruled for 111 years. When she died in SA 2637 at the age of 360 years, the Kingship should have gone to her son, Tar-Alcarin, but Herucalmo usurped the throne and ruled for twenty years as King Tar-Anducal. His rule was not considered legitimate, and in the official records Vanimeldë was directly followed by Alcarin.[1]

Etymology
Vanimeldë means ""Beautiful Beloved"" from the Quenya vanima (""beautiful, fair"")[2][3] and melda (""beloved"").[3]

Númenóreans (House of Elros)



Silmariën was a noblewoman of Númenór known for being the progenitor of the Lords of Andúnië, and receiver of many heirlooms passed to her later Dúnedain descendants.

Contents[show]
 Biography 
Silmariën was the oldest child of King Tar-Elendil. Her other siblings were Isilmë and Meneldur. Women were not allowed to rule at the time of her father, so when Tar-Elendil relinquished the Sceptre, she was passed over for the throne in favor of her younger brother, Tar-Meneldur. After her marriage with Elatan, they had a son named Valandil who became the first Lord of Andúnië.[2]

 Legacy 
From her and her husband's lineage came the Kings of Gondor and Arnor living in exile in Middle-earth. Nevertheless, she was one of the most significant of Númenor's royal family, as she presumably inherited both the sword Narsil and the Ring of Barahir from Tar-Elendil, her father.[3] These heirlooms were then handed down to her descendants, the Lords of Andúnië and later the Kings of Gondor and Arnor. The royal jewel, Elendilmir, included a fillet of Mithril that had once belonged to Silmariën survived the Fall of Númenor to become part of the crown of Arnor, and eventually survived up until the time of King Aragorn Elessar.[4]

Etymology
The name Silmariën was a Quenya word that was likely to have meant ""silver maiden"". It came from the words silma (""silver, shining white"") and rien (""maiden, daughter""). Although unlikely, Silmariën may even have meant ""maiden crowned with silver"", as the Sindarin word ríen means (""crowned lady, queen"").[5]

Tar-Meneldur was the fifth King of Númenor. His two older sisters were Silmariën and Isilmë. During his time the Númenóreans began to return to Middle-earth, and great fleets of ships were built to explore all the lands east of Númenor.

Contents[show]
 Biography 
Tar-Meneldur succeeded his father, Tar-Elendil, because the rules of succession did not allow women to rule, per the principle of agnatic primogeniture. Had the principle of equal primogeniture been followed instead, control of the throne would have passed to Silmariën.
Tar-Meneldur married Almarian and had three children: Tar-Aldarion, Ailinel, and Almiel.
During the rule of Tar-Meneldur, contact with the Middle Men of Eriador was reestablished under guidance of the elves of Lindon under Gil-galad. Tar-Meneldur encouraged the seafarers, and allowed his son Aldarion to establish a guild of seafarers, which became one of the most powerful organisations in Númenor. Many voyages along the coasts were made at this time, and the first settlements were made in Middle-earth by Númenórean explorers, although none of them permanent yet. These early settlements were however the later cores of Arnor and Gondor, and the reestablished contact of Númenóreans with their distant kin allowed the Adûnaic tongue to merge with local, far akin languages, eventually leading to the Westron speech. This would in later years prove to be one of the greatest assets to the power of Númenor in Middle-earth.
Near the end of Tar-Meneldur's rule reports came that evil had begun to stir in the east of Middle-earth (the first awakenings of Sauron, as was later learned), and Gil-galad requested the aid of Tar-Meneldur. Recognizing his son Aldarion was more aware of the troubles, and was a powerful leader of men, Meneldur abdicated in favour of his son far earlier than was expected.
On the family front Meneldur, together with his wife Almarian, attempted to mediate between his son Aldarion and Aldarion's betrothed Erendis, who had become estranged. For a time they were successful, and Aldarion and Erendis were wed, but Aldarion soon left again for sea. It was during his long absence in Middle-earth, a time during which Aldarion was instructed by Gil-galad, that Erendis left the royal court for her home. By the time Aldarion returned even Meneldur's best attempts could not heal the breach.
Meneldur was a lover of star-lore and enjoyed watching their motions. For this purpose he built a tower in the north of Forostar.[3]
Meneldur died in SA 942 after a rule of 143 years, at the age of 399 years.[2]

 Etymology 
Meneldur means ""Servant of Heaven"" in Quenya.[citation needed]","

Valandil was the youngest of Isildur's four sons, he was only a child at the time of the War of the Last Alliance, in which his grandfather, Elendil, was killed. Due to this, he remained in Rivendell when his father and brothers went into the south, and was thus the only one of Isildur's sons to survive the Disaster of the Gladden Fields. He received the Shards of Narsil as an heirloom of the Heirs of Isildur when he came of age.[3] Valandil became king in TA 10[1] and ruled Arnor for two-hundred and thirty-nine years, which was longer than any King in the North or South, and he lived for two-hundred and sixty years dying in TA 249.
He was succeeded by his son Eldacar[2]

 Etymology 
Valandil was a Quenya word that meant 'Valar-lover'.[4] or 'Friend of the Valar'.

Tarcil was the sixth King of Arnor.

Contents[show]
 Biography 
Tarcil was born in TA 280 to Arantar and his unnamed wife. He ascended the throne of Arnor in TA 435 on the death of his father. His reign was without event for eighty years and he died in TA 515 and was succeeded by his son Tarondor. He was two-hundred and thirty-five years of age.[2]

 Etymology 
The name Tarcil (also spelt Tarkil) also appears in The History of The Lord of the Rings as another nickname for Aragorn: its meaning is apparently ""High Man"", a synonym for Dúnadan. The Orcish term ""tark"" for a Dúnadan is without doubt derived from this.[citation needed]","

 This article is about the king of Arnor. For the king of Gondor, see Tarondor.

Tarondor was the seventh King of Arnor.

Contents[show]
 Biography 
Tarondor was born in TA 372 to Tarcil and his unnamed wife.[1] He ascended to the throne of Arnor in TA 515 on the death of his father Tarcil. His reign, from his accession, was a difficult one and there was trouble within the realm. This resulted in him having to completely reorganize most of the Realm of Arnor, which slowly recouped its strength. He died in TA 602 after an eighty-seven year rule, and was succeeded by his son Valandur.[2]

 Etymology 
Tarondor was Quenyan word that meant 'Royal Rock'.[3]

 Biography 
Valandur was born in TA 462 to Tarondor and his unnamed wife.[1] He ascended the throne of Arnor in TA 602 on the death of his father Tarondor. He was killed in a battle or a violent encounter of some sort in TA 652, but the exact circumstances of his death were unknown. He ruled for fifty years and lived one-hundred and ninety years. He was succeeded by his son, Elendur.<[2]

 Etymology 
Valandur's name probably meant 'Servant of the Valar' in Quenya.[3]

Ñoldor (House of Fingolfin)



Argon was the fourth child and the youngest son of Fingolfin, the High King of the Ñoldor in Beleriand. He was one of the mighty Prince of the Noldor in Tirion, Valinor. Furthermore, Argon grew up in Valinor, until later, the Noldor went into exile for Middle-earth where he journeyed with his father Fingolfin and his siblings.

Contents[show]
 Biography 
    From left to right: Fingon, Turgon, Aredhel, and Argon  
Argon was therefore the last child and the third son of Fingolfin and Anairë who was also of the Noldor. Argon was the younger brother of Fingon, Turgon, and Aredhel his elder sister. He was most likely born in Tirion during the Years of the Trees. He was described to be the tallest of his brothers and most impetuous. He followed his father through Helcaraxë and set foot on Middle-earth during the First Age. During the Battle of Lhammoth, Argon hewed a path through the foes and killed the orc captain, before he himself was slain.[1]
Argon was less than 1381 years old when he was killed - a young age for an Elf. His death was the first signs of the Doom of Mandos.

 Etymology 
Arakáno thus never received a true Sindarin name, but Argon was later devised for him in the records. It is recorded that this later became a popular name under the Eldar. His Quenya name was Arakáno (""High Commander""), named so partially for his character.[2]

Ñoldor (House of Mahtan)



Mahtan was a renowned Ñoldorin metallurgist of Aman and the father of Nerdanel, the wife of Fëanor.

Contents[show]
 Biography 
Mahtan was a skilled smith in Valinor learning the arts of metal and stone work under the direction of the Vala Aulë.[2] He wore a copper circlet around his head and was known for his fondness for the metal more than gold. Mahtan passed on his knowledge to his eager pupil and son-in-law Fëanor who surpassed his teacher by becoming the greatest of all Elven craftsmen. When Fëanor and certain Ñoldor became more proud and suspicious of other Ñoldor kin due to the lies of Melkor, and began forging weapons and armour of war the first ever in Valinor, Mahtan came to regret teaching him given the way he was using his knowledge. Later, Nerdanel became estranged from her husband and retired back to Mahtan's house. The servants of Aulë counselled against joining the Revolt of the Ñoldor and therefore he chose not to rebel and remained in Valinor in peace forever after.[1]
Mahtan had a beard - unusual for an Elf, especially a young one. According to J.R.R. Tolkien, most elves could only grow beards from the ""third cycle"" of their lives, while Mahtan was an exception in being only early in his second. It is unclear what these ""cycles"" actually refer to.[3]

 Etymology 
The name Mahtan seems to come from the Quenyan mahta- (""to handle""), reference to the arts and skills of making. His devotion to Aulë had earned him the name Aulëndur (""Servant of Aulë"")[4] from -ndur (""to serve"").[5] The earlier form of this name was Aulëndil, which was later used by Sauron during his treachery to Númenor. His other name Urundil means ""Copper-lover""[4] from urun (""copper"") and -ndil (""lover, friend"").[5][6] His other epessë Rusco meant ""Fox"", a reference to his red-brown hair.[1]

Númenóreans (House of Elros)



Tar-Aldarion was the sixth King of Númenor, and succeeded his father, Tar-Meneldur. Tar-Aldarion was married to Erendis, a Númenórean woman, who was not quite of the same status as Aldarion himself, and therefore had a shorter life-span. Aldarion's love for the sea ultimately caused a rift between the couple and they separated in SA 882.[1] The tale of their marriage and estrangement survived the Downfall of Númenor as ""Aldarion and Erendis, The Mariner's Wife"".

Contents[show]
 Biography 
Tar-Aldarion was called ""The Mariner"", and his name signifies ""of the trees"" because he was a noted tree steward and forester — trees were essential to the construction of his fleets, but he took great care to replenish what was being felled. His first love was the sea, and he was already a great explorer before he became king. He made several journeys to Middle-earth and established contact with Gil-galad in his realm in the Grey Havens making friendship and alliance with him. He also established a vital Númenorean port in Middle-earth, named Vinyalonde. He built the great haven of Lond Daer on the river Gwathló, and under his reign the deforesting of Enedwaith and Minhiriath began.[3]
His only child was a daughter, Tar-Ancalimë, so he changed the rules of succession, replacing the principle of agnatic primogeniture with that of fully equal primogeniture. She became the first ruling Queen of Númenor. If the law hadn't been changed then the throne would have passed to his sister's son Soronto, heir presumptive at the time.
The partial story of Aldarion and Erendis can be found in Tolkien's Unfinished Tales, (ed. Christopher Tolkien). Though the actual story was left incomplete, the book does give some hints on how it continued. The story also contains the first hints of the return of the Shadow, i.e. Sauron, to Middle-earth.[4][2]

 Etymology 
Aldarion is Quenya which means ""Son of trees"" from alda (""trees"")[5] and -ion (""son"").[6]

Edain (House of Hador)



Hador Goldenhead, known also as Hador Lórindol, was a great chieftain of the Edain in the First Age of Middle-earth, and a revered Edain among many of the greatest Elf-friends of the Eldar. He became the first Lord of Dor-lómin and was accounted mighty even among the Eldar. Hador and his wife Gildis had three children: Glóredhel the first child and only daughter, Galdor the second child and elder son, and Gundor the last child and younger son.

Contents[show]
 Biography 
    Heraldic Device of the House of Hador  
Hador was the son of Hathol and the great-great-grandson of Marach, (who first led the people of the Third House into Beleriand and was their first chieftain), and heir to the House of Marach. He entered the service of Fingolfin, the High King of the Ñoldor, at a young age. Hador was loved by the King, and he rose high in the esteem of many of the Eldar. Eventually, Hador would even become a part of Fingolfin's own council. Realizing the need for the Edain to live under their own lords and have lands of their own, Fingolfin granted as a fief to Hador the land of Dor-lómin (land of echoes) which thus made him the first Lord of Dor-lómin. Hador gathered most of the people of the Third House into that land, which lay in Hithlum between the Kingdom of Fingolfin and his eldest son Fingon. There, Hador's people became numerous; and he encouraged the use of the Sindarin tongue.
Hador continued to win renown among the Eldar as the Lord of Dor-lómin, as well as among Men. Two of Hador's children, Galdor and Glóredhel, were wedded to two of the children of Halmir Chieftain of the Haladin, respectively Hareth his daughter and Haldir his son of the House of Haleth, when the two peoples met for a great feast. Fingolfin also gave to Hador a great helm made by Telchar of Nogrod. It was made in the likeness of the dragon Glaurung, and came to be known as the Dragon-helm of Dor-lómin; it could only be borne by one of great stature and strength. In the year 455 of the First Age, Morgoth broke the Siege of Angband in the Dagor Bragollach. Hador fought alongside Fingolfin with what few warriors of the Third House he could gather against the swift onset of Morgoth's forces. He was slain, however, defending the retreat of his lord. His younger son, Gundor, fell beside him before the fortress of Eithel Sirion. It was said that their deaths were greatly mourned by the Eldar.

   The Dragon Helm, by Alan Lee.  
Though he was accounted one of the mightiest chieftain of the Edain in the First Age, Hador is not well-known aside from being the namesake of the Third House of the Edain. However, he was the forefather of many other heroes. His grandsons were Hurin and Huor. His great-grandsons were Túrin and Tuor Eladar, and his great-great grandson was Eärendil the Mariner. Aragorn Elessar, as well as all the Kings of Númenor, Gondor and Arnor were descended from Hador.[2] Perhaps the greatest testament to the legacy of Hador was that which was later written about his descendants:
""The Men of the Three Houses throve and multiplied, but greatest among them was the house of Hador Goldenhead, peer of Elven-lords. His people were of great strength and stature, ready in mind, bold and steadfast, quick to anger and to laughter, mighty among the Children of Ilúvatar in the youth of Mankind.""

Nimrodel was an Nandorin Elf Maiden of Lórien in the Third Age.

Contents[show]
 Biography 
Nimrodel had lived in Lothlórien before the Sindar and Ñoldor were seen in the forest. She was unhappy with these newcomers, as she thought they would bring the turmoils of Middle-earth to the golden forest. She lived separately near the river that would later bear her name, and spoke only her native tongue. The only good thing she saw in Lórien was the Sinda Amroth, the King of the Wood. She loved him, and he loved her, but refused to marry him.[2]
After the Balrog awoke in nearby Khazad-dûm in TA 1980, Nimrodel grew even uneasier in Lórien. She fled, and made her way to the edge of Fangorn Forest, but could not enter it. Amroth found her, and promised her peace. Together they would travel to Edhellond, the port city in Belfalas, and thence set sail to the Undying Lands. They were accompanied by a small staff of Silvan Elves, including Mithrellas. All went well until they reached the White Mountains in TA 1981. The group became separated and Amroth reached Edhellond well before the others. He decided to wait for his love aboard their ship. When a storm broke loose and swept the ship out of port, Amroth leaped overboard, hoping to swim back to shore. But he was quickly taken by Belegaer's strong currents and drowned.[2]
Nimrodel, in the meantime, had settled for a while at the river Gilrain, which reminded her of home. She sat by the starlit stream and slept for a long while. After waking she journeyed further, but found no ship in Edhellond, and Amroth was long dead at the bottom of the sea.[2]
After she found no ship in Edhellond and found out that her lover Amroth drowned in the sea. What she did after leaving the haven was unknown. She might have died later due to a broken heart.

 In song 
Years later, the Song of Nimrodel were sung in by the Elves in Rivendell and Silvan Elves in Northern Mirkwood. According to Legolas, the song was long and sad.[1]

 Etymology 
Nimrodel means ""Lady of the White Grotto""[3] from the Sindarin element nim (""white"").[4] The name was of Lemberin language (later Avarin or Telerian), along with other Sindarin names such as Amroth, Legolas, and Thranduil.[5]

 Other forms of the legendarium 
Nimrodel was initially given various names, such as Inglorel, Linglorel, or Nimlothel among others. Her lover was first named Ammalas (later Amroth).[6]

Mithrellas and Imrazor the Numenorean, by Steamey

Culture
Galadhrim



Mithrellas was a Silvan Elf who, according to the tradition of the House of Angelimir, accompanied Nimrodel from Lothlórien on her journey to the southern havens. Mithrellas, it is said, became lost in the woods of Belfalas, where she was found by Imrazôr the Númenórean, who married her. So Elvish blood entered the line of the Princes of Dol Amroth, it was claimed, and her son Galador became the first of the long line of Princes. Mithrellas also bore Imrazôr a daughter, Gilmith.[1]

Contents[show]
 Etymology 
Mithrellas was a Sindarin word of unknown meaning. There appear to be many possibilities to the origin of her name, including mith, which can be interpreted as both ""grey"" and ""mist"", rein, renia or revia, which can be interpreted as ""wandering"", ""track"" or ""sail"", and las, meaning ""leaf"" (especially pertaining to trees).
If these words were to be the origins of the name Mithrellas, it could possibly, and rather unusually mean ""wandering leaf of the mist"" or ""wandering grey leaf"", though it is unlikely.

Teleri, later Falmari (House of Olwë)



Olwë was an Elf of the Teleri of Aman. When he and his kin reached Aman, they chose to remain there in both Tol Eressëa and Alqualondë apart from the rest of the Elves of Aman. He became both Lord of Alqualondë and King of the Teleri.
Olwë was the father of Eärwen and had several unnamed sons.[2] He was the younger brother of Elwë (Elu Thingol) and the older brother of Elmo.[3] Other Telerin elves such Nowë (Círdan) were said to be akin to Olwë.[4]

Contents[show]
 Biography 
Elwë and Olwë were both lords of the third clan of the elves, the later Teleri, and together they lead their people from Cuiviénen to the West.[5] However, during a long wait in Beleriand Elwë disappeared. After years of searching, Olwë grew impatient, and led the greater part of the Teleri to Valinor, on the insistence of the Vala Ulmo.[2]
Olwë became Lord of the island of Tol Eressëa, where the Teleri built a great number of cities, and grew in number. When they finally came to Eldamar some centuries later, Olwë became Lord of Alqualondë. His daughter Eärwen married Finarfin son of Finwë[2] and later High King of the Ñoldor in Valinor, and thus their children, when these returned to Middle-earth, could claim kinship to Thingol, for Eärwen had several sons.
When Fëanor resolved to return to Middle-earth in pursuit of Morgoth, he came to Alqualondë and spoke to the Teleri asking for aid and for the use of the Swanships but he could not move them. He then grew hot and wrathful and, grudging he spoke to Olwë, he accused him of renouncing their friendship and for being ungrateful for the help that the Ñoldor had given his people in the past. Then Olwë said to Fëanor that this was not so and that he believed that as a friend it was right for him to keep a friend from doing something unwise. Then he spoke to him of the many things that they accomplished on their own without any aid from the Ñoldor, and that the Swanships were one of those things and were very dear to them.[6]
Seeing that he was not going to get what he wanted, Fëanor waited beyond the walls until he gathered his strength and then in defiance of Olwë he and his people began manning the ships. His people resisted and a battle had begun and many on both sides were slain, but the Teleri withstood them for a time. Then the host of Fingon arrived and believing that the Teleri had been told to waylay the Ñoldor by command of the Valar, joined the battle and the Teleri were overcome. No doubt Olwë had watched in horror many of his people dying and he could do little for he called upon Ossë, their patron Maia but there was no answer.[6]
The cruel slaying at the havens continued to haunt Olwë and his people for many years to come. Towards the end of the First Age when the Valar were preparing for the final assault on Morgoth, the Teleri of Olwë agreed only to sail the ships for very few of them were willing to go to war.[7]

 Etymology 
It is mentioned that the name Olwë seems to have no meaning. There are provided ""extended"" stems such as olos (""dream"") and olob (""branch"") but no connections to the Telerin elf.[8] He was called Volwë by some of the Teleri.[9]

Tar-Palantir's father, Ar-Gimilzôr, whom he succeeded, was an opponent of the Valar and the Elves. Inzilbêth, the queen, taught her son to be an admirer of the Elves.
Ar-Inziladun took power during a time of great darkness in Númenor; ever since Tar-Atanamir, many kings had spoken against the Valar and questioned the policies laid before them. Tar-Palantir, however, sought to repent the actions of his predecessors; he once again tended to the White Tree and followed the ancient practices. However, there was no response from the Valar, and Tol Eressëa could not be seen from the tower of Tar-Minastir.
His daughter, Tar-Míriel was his successor and would have followed his policies, but her rightful place as Queen of Númenor was usurped by her husband, Ar-Pharazôn.[1][2]

 Etymology 
His name in Quenya was written in the Scrolls, as it was with the ancient practices. Palantir in Quenya means ""far sighted,""[3] as Palantir indeed saw the destruction that would come to Númenor if it kept going down the path of disobedience to the Valar. His Adûnaic name was Ar-Inziladûn, which means ""Flower of the West"". Tar-Palantir repented and sought to amend the ways of the prior kings, although it was already too late.

Ar-Zimrathôn was the twenty-first King of Númenor.

Biography
Like his father Ar-Adûnakhôr, Ar-Zimrathôn opposed the Valar, and he took his name in the Adûnaic tongue rather than in the traditional Quenya. But Númenórean scholars recorded his Quenya name Tar-Hostamir so as to not offend the Valar. His name in both languages means ""Jewel Gatherer"", perhaps implying a greedy nature.
Ar-Zimrathôn died in SA 3033, living to the age of two-hundred and thirty-five and ruled Númenor for seventy-one years, and was succeeded by his son, Ar-Sakalthôr.[1]

Vidumavi was one of the race of the Northmen , the daughter of Vidugavia, the Princess of Rhovanion.

Contents[show]
 Biography 
Vidumavi married Gondor's King Valacar when he was on a diplomatic mission in Rhovanion. The Dúnedain of Gondor feared that a shorter-lived bloodline would weaken Gondor's noble line.[1] In TA 1255, she bore Valacar a son and heir, the future King Eldacar. Because of Eldacar's short-lived Northman mother, many of the Dúnedain and Men of Gondor were unwilling to accept him as their future king. This lead to the disastrous Kin-strife eighty-eight years later in TA 1432.[2]
She was also known by the name Galadwen after coming to Gondor with her husband and child.[1]

 Etymology 
The name Vidumavi is a Latinised version of the Gothic word Widumawi (wood-maiden).[3]

Rómendacil II was the son of King Calmacil, the second son of King Atanatar II Alcarin and was originally named Minalcar.

Contents[show]
 Biography 
Minalcar was born in TA 1126, toward the end of the long reign of Hyarmendacil I as Minalcar and he rose to a powerful position early because his uncle Narmacil I (first son of Atanatar II) felt uncomfortable with the Kingship.
He was Regent of Gondor from TA 1240 and struck a decisive blow against the Easterlings whom he defeated near the Sea of Rhûn. He also fortified Gondor and made pacts with the Northmen of Rhovanion, all before he took the throne. After Narmacil's death, he remained Regent for ten years under his father Calmacil.
When he finally ascended to the throne after the death of his father, he immediately took the name Rómendacil, the East-victor, as his distant forefather Tarostar had done. He was responsible for the Argonath, the pillars of the Kings. They were known to stand above Nen Hithoel far into the Fourth Age and appear prominently in The Lord of the Rings.
To cement an alliance with the Northmen, Rómendacil II sent his son Valacar as an ambassador. While Valacar was on his mission he married Vidumavi, the daughter of Vidugavia, the King of Rhovanion.[2][2] In TA 1260, he summoned him and his Northmen family back to Gondor, to take part in the duties of the realm. This was controversial and would ultimately lead to the disastrous Kin-strife.[3]
Rómendacil died in TA 1366 after 62 years of rule and was succeeded by Valacar.

 Etymology 
Rómendacil was a Quenya word that meant 'East-victor'.[4]

Dúnedain of the North (House of Isildur), Rangers of the North



Aranarth was the first of the Chieftains of the Dúnedain, and would have been King of Arnor at the death of his father Arvedui, the last King of Arnor, had the North Kingdom not fallen. He also was chieftain for longer than any would be after him, ruling for 131 years.

Contents[show]
 Biography 
Aranarth was born in TA 1938 to Arvedui and Fíriel. In his youth, the Witch-king of Angmar was at the height of its power and destroyed the Northern Kingdom, overrunning its capital city Fornost. Most of the surviving people, including Aranarth, fled to Lindon, but King Arvedui went north to the Icebay of Forochel. Aranarth urged Círdan to send ships to rescue Arvedui, but this ship never returned. It was later learned that the ship had sunk with Arvedui on board as well as the Palantiri of the north.[2]
By right, this made Aranarth now King of Arnor, but since that was lost he could not claim the title. Aranarth rode with the army of Gondor under Eärnur and saw the destruction of Angmar. Aranarth's people became known as the Rangers of the North (or Dúnedain), and he was the first of their Chieftains who dwelt in the wilds of in Eriador. In time, their origins were generally forgotten by the common people of Arnor.[2]
While the Rangers defended Arnor from the remnants of Angmar's evil, the Wizard Gandalf went to Dol Guldur, and drove out Sauron the Necromancer. Thus began the period known as the Watchful Peace, a time where attacks by the enemy were few and far between. Aranarth's son Arahael was born in Rivendell, and was given a name with the Kingly prefix of Ar(a)-, to signify that by right he would be King of Arnor.
Arahael succeeded his father at his death in TA 2106. Aranarth must have had other children apart from Arahael, considering Dírhael was known to be a descendant of his.

 Portrayal in adaptations 
     
A Dúnedain statue fashioned in the likeness of Aranarth appears in the video game The Lord of the Rings Online. It can be found in the region of Bree-land, south of Staddle.

 Etymology 
In Sindarin, Aranarth means ""Noble King"", from aran (""king"") and arth (""noble, exalted"").[3]

Argeleb I was the seventh King of Arthedain.

Contents[show]
 Biography 
    Argeleb as he lies dying on the battlefield  
Argeleb succeeded his father Malvegil in TA 1349 when he died, because the line of kings of the Dúnedain of the North had failed in the realms of Cardolan and Rhudaur. Argeleb claimed the Kingship of all of Arnor again, taking the royal prefix ar(a)- as a sign. He was thus not only the seventh King of Arthedain, but also the seventeenth King of Arnor. Cardolan accepted this rule, but it was too late for Rhudaur as it had by then fallen under the control of Angmar, and therefore resisted his rule. As a result of this breach, war broke out between the two opposing sides. Argeleb fortified the hills at Weathertop, and was killed in TA 1356 by evil men from Rhudaur, under the command of the Witch-king of Angmar.
Argeleb I was king for only seven years and was succeeded by his son Arveleg I. He was one-hundred-thirty years old when he died.[2]

 Etymology 
Argeleb was a Sindarin name which means ""Silver King"" or ""Royal Silver"", from the words ar (""royal, high"") and celeb or later geleb[3] (""silver"").[4]

 Portrayal in adaptations 
 Video games 
Argeleb is a character in the campaign of EA's The Lord of the Rings: The Battle for Middle-earth II: The Rise of the Witch-king. His role is mostly the same as in the books.

Malvegil was the sixth King of Arthedain.

Contents[show]
 Biography 
Malvegil was the son of King Celebrindor of Arthedain and came to the throne in TA 1272 at the death of his father. Under his rule the enemy realm of Angmar was established by the Witch-King in the north of the Ettenmoors in the mountains, and evil things began to appear in Arnor. Many Orcs and evil Men began to gather on both sides of the Misty Mountains, and Arthedain was in an uneasy watch ever after. Malvegil died in TA 1349 at the age of two-hundred and five after ruling for seventy-seven years and was succeeded by his son Argeleb I.[2]

 Etymology 
The name Malvegil means ""Golden sword"" from the Sindarin words mal (""gold"") and megil or later vegil[3] (""sword"").[4]

Celebrindor was the fifth King of Arthedain.

Contents[show]
 Biography 
Celebrindor was the son of King Celepharn of Arthedain. He came to the throne in TA 1191 at the death of his father. During Celebrindor's rule over Arthedain, there was peace between relations with the other splinter-realms of Arnor, Cardolan and Rhudaur and therefore his reign was an uneventful one, and no evil threatened the realm as of yet. Celebrindor died in TA 1272 after ruling for eighty-one years and was succeeded by his son Malvegil.[2]

 Etymology 
Celebrindor was a Sindarin name that probably meant 'silver[3]lord' or 'silverlike lord'.

 Former names 
As outlined in The Peoples of Middle-earth: The Heirs of Elendil, Celebrindor was first written as Celemenegil and Celebrindol but was corrected and changed to Celebrindor.[1]

Celepharn was the fourth King of Arthedain.

Contents[show]
 Biography 
Celepharn was the son and heir of King Mallor of Arthedain. He came to the throne in TA 1110 at the death of his father. During his reign, many Hobbits entered Eriador and the lands of Arnor. Most of these were Fallohides and Stoors, joining the Harfoots, who had come earlier during the time of Celepharn's grandfather Beleg.
During Celepharn's rule, the Southern Kingdom Gondor reached the height of its power under Atanatar II Alcarin. Celepharn died in TA 1191 after ruling for eighty-one years and was succeeded by his son Celebrindor.[2]

 Etymology 
The name Celepharn was a Sindarin word of unknown meaning. Although there appears to be no definitive origin, it may have come from the words celeb (""silver"") and faran or farn which refers to any growing plant.[3] If this were to be so, his name could have meant ""silver plant"".
A much more plausible theory is that Celepharn comes from celeb (""silver"") and sarn (small stone) thus meaning ""silver stone"".

 Biography 
Mallor was the son and heir of King Beleg of Arthedain and became king in TA 1029 at the death of his father, when he was 134 years old. During his reign, the Order of the Wizards came to Middle-earth from Valinor, but at the time their origins was not known. Near the end of Mallor's reign it was revealed that the shadow that had fallen over Mirkwood came from Dol Guldur, but Sauron's presence there remained unknown. Mallor died in TA 1110 after ruling for eighty-one years and was succeeded by his son Celepharn.[2]

Contents[show]
 Biography 
Beleg was the son and heir of King Amlaith of Arthedain and came to the throne in TA 946 at the death of his father. During his reign, Hobbits were first seen west of the Misty Mountains, entering Eriador. Most of them were Harfoots. Also during his reign Sauron returned to Mirkwood, his first return to Middle-earth since the end of the Second Age.
Beleg died in TA 1029 at the age of two-hundred and eighteen after ruling for eighty-three years and was succeeded by his son Mallor.[2]

 Etymology 
He shares a name with Beleg Cúthalion, the famous Sindarin bowman of Doriath and friend of Túrin Turambar. The name means 'mighty'.[3]

Dúnedain of the North (House of Isildur)



Araphant was a Dúnedain of the North and the fourteenth King of Arthedain.

Contents[show]
 Biography 
Araphant was the son and heir of King Araval who came to the throne in TA 1891 at the death of his father. During his reign the the well-known seer Malbeth predicted regarding the fate of his son Arvedui. For some five-hundred years, Arthedain held off the constant attacks of the evil realm of Angmar. Araphant continued fighting off these attacks with failing strength.[3]
Araphant continued his father's policy of alliance with Gondor, and he forged an alliance with Gondor's King Ondoher, leading to a marriage between Ondoher's daughter Fíriel and Araphant's son Arvedui. Four years later King Ondoher died during an attack of the Wainriders, and Araphant's son Arvedui made a claim for the throne of Gondor by right of his blood connection to Isildur, and his wife Fíriel, who by the laws of Númenor should have become the Ruling Queen. This claim was denied by Gondor, and the the kingship of Gondor passed to Eärnil II.
Araphant died in TA 1964 after ruling for seventy-three years, and was succeeded by his son Arvedui.[2]

 Etymology 
The name Araphant comes from Sindarin and literally translates into ""Full King"", from ar(a) ("" king, noble, royal"") and panta (""full"").[4]

Tar-Minastir was the eleventh King of Númenor. He was King during the War of the Elves and Sauron in the mid-Second Age, he helped defeat Sauron by sending a relief force to the aid of Gil-galad who was under siege in Middle-earth.[2]

Contents[show]
 Biography 
Tar-Minastir was the son of Isilmo and succeeded his aunt, Queen Tar-Telperiën, when she died. He was the grandson of King Tar-Súrion. His heart yearned for the west as did many in his time and loved the Elves but envied them. At some point during his rule, he had a Great Tower built on Oromet so that he could gaze upon the west and dream.
During his rule, Sauron invaded Eriador from Calenardhon in SA 1695 and realms of Eregion fell. Sauron advanced to Lindon and Rivendell. In SA 1700, Tar-Minastir sent a naval force under the command of Ciryatur to save Lindon. Ciryatur's forces stopped Sauron's army at the river Gwathló; reinforcements from Lindon and Tharbad helped defeat Sauron at the Battle of the Gwathló. Battered but not utterly defeated Sauron retreated back to Mordor in SA 1701 swearing revenge.
From around the 1800s in the, Númenóreans began establishing permanent settlements in Middle-earth, including Umbar.
He abdicated the throne in SA 1869 dying peacefully four years later. He was succeeded by his son, Tar-Ciryatan.[1] He reigned for 138 years. 

 Etymology 
The name Tar-Minastir name means ""Tower-watcher"" in Quenya, which perhaps signifies ""The Vigilant"".[3]

Númenórean (House of Elros)



Tar-Ciryatan or Ar-Balkumagân in Adûnaic, was the twelfth King of Númenor. His rule marked the first coming of the shadow upon the Númenóreans and their rulers, the speaking out openly against the Valar and the Ban, colonialism, and dominion abroad.

Contents[show]
 Biography 
Tar-Ciryatan was born in SA 1634 and was the son of Tar-Minastir. He loved ships and everything connected to ship-lore and ship building. His heart was restless in Númenor and before succeeding his father, he went on many voyages around the world travelling east, north, and south but never west as many yearned to do but never could because of the Ban of the Valar.
He succeeded his father in SA 1869 and became a mighty king building great armadas of ships and the Númenóreans began large scale colonization of the coastal cities, and held the peoples of Middle-earth in subjugation demanding great tribute from them. As Tar-Ciryatan was greedy of wealth in these days, he received the pick of the many metals and gems that had been taken by his men in payment or as spoils of war.
He abdicated in SA 2029 after ruling for one-hundred and sixty years and was succeeded by his son, Tar-Atanamir. He died in SA 2035.[2]

Etymology
The name Tar-Ciryatan literally means 'Ship-builder' in Quenya.[3]

Portrayal in adaptations
In a role-playing game he was also referred to as the father of the Witch-king of Angmar, but this relationship does not appear anywhere in Tolkien's work.

Tar-Atanamir also known as Atanamir the Great was the thirteenth King of Númenor.[1].
He is best known for being the first to openly question the Ban of the Valar.[2]

Contents[show]
 Biography 
Tar-Atanamir succeeded his father, King Tar-Ciryatan in SA 2029. He was married to an unnamed woman and had a son named Tar-Ancalimon and another unnamed child that eventually led up to Herucalmo.[1][3] Tar-Atanamir began to speak against the Valar especially the Ban of the Valar, and to advocate opposition to the Valar themselves. He was also the first king who was unwilling to give up his throne voluntarily before his death, and to let himself die while he was still strong in mind and body. His reign is thus generally considered to constitute the beginning of Númenor's moral decline.[2]
He was the first king to refuse to die willingly and give up the sceptre; death instead took him by force and thus his reign ended. Thus every king afterwards did not renounce his reign except for Tar-Palantir. Tar-Atanamir ruled for one hundred ninety-two years and was succeeded by his son, Tar-Ancalimon.[2]

Tar-Atanamir is a Quenya word that means ""Jewel of Man"" from atan (""man"") and mir (""jewel"").[4]

Tar-Ancalimon was the fourteenth King of Númenor. He succeeded his father, Tar-Atanamir.

Contents[show]
 Biography 
During Tar-Ancalimon's reign, the people of Númenór became divided and two opposing parties arose among Númenóreans: the Elf-friends, or Elendili (also called ""The Faithful""), advocated continuing devotion to the Valar and friendship with the Elves, and the ""King's Men"" who opposed the ban, the Elves propounded, and advocated Men's independence and self-determination, seeing how they had reached the apex of their might.
During his time, the Elven tongues were discouraged and were no longer taught to Númenórean children. The royal titles however were still taken in Quenya out of respect for ancient customs rather than love for the Eldar. His policies would later contribute to the Fall of Númenor.
Tar-Ancalimon ruled for one-hundred and sixty-five years and was succeeded by his son, Tar-Telemmaitë.[1]

 Etymology 
Tar-Ancalimon means Ancalimon means ""Most Bright"".[citation needed]","

Tar-Telemmaitë was the fifteenth King of Númenor.[1]

Contents[show]
 Biography 
Tar-Telemmaitë succeeded his father, Tar-Ancalimon. During his reign, he bade his servants to seek for Mithril, which they did not find for mithril was only found in Moria. He ruled Númenor for 140 years, and was 390 when he died. His daughter, Tar-Vanimeldë, succeeded him and became Númenor's third Ruling Queen.[1]

 Etymology 
The name Telemmaitë means ""Silver-handed"", reflecting his greed for the precious metal mithril.[2]

Elendur was the eldest son and apparent heir of Isildur, who fell along with two of his brothers at the Gladden Fields at the beginning of the Third Age.

Contents[show]
 Biography 
Elendur was born in Númenór and followed his father and his grandfather Elendil in the fleet that was blown to Middle-earth after the Fall of Númenór. Elendur probably lived with his father within the Realms in Exile, likely in Arnor.
Elendur was the only son of Isildur to have a role with the army of the Last Alliance, fighting in the Battle Of Dagorlad and accompanied his father in Mordor during the Siege of Barad-dûr. His younger brothers were sent to man Minas Ithil, so Sauron could not escape into the mountains that way. As the eldest son of Isildur, Elendur was high in the confidence of his father; Elendur alone of the sons knew the existence of the Ring in his father's possession and counselled Isildur to turnover the One Ring to the Keepers of the Three Rings. He was slain in the disaster of the Gladden Fields with his father and younger brothers Aratan and Ciryon. He had a squire named Estelmo who survived the massacre. His brother Valandil, who was still a child, had remained in Imladris and so lived to rule Arnor.
Aragorn is stated to have resembled this son of Isildur ""in body and mind"", even though he was not descended directly from him. Elendur himself was noted to have borne a striking resemblance to his grandfather Elendil.[3]

 Etymology 
The name Elendur has two possible meanings; the first being ""elf servant"" and the second being ""star servant"". It appears to be made from the Quenyan words elen (""star"") and -ndur (""follower, servant"") or -ndil (""friend"").[4] The name may have also come from Elendil (meaning ""devoted to the stars"").

 Portrayals in adaptations 
 In The Lord of the Rings Online the three elder sons of Isildur appear during an extended flashback set during the Siege of Barad-dûr in the year S.A. 3440. However, because the game's license does cover the works in which they are named, they are referred to only by their war-time aliases, meant to hide their kinship with the King. Elendur uses the name ""Meldaran"" as his alias.

Dúnedain of the North (House of Isildur)



Amlaith, also known as Amlaith of Fornost,[1] was the first King of Arthedain.

Contents[show]
Biography
Amlaith of Fornost was the eldest son of Eärendur of Arnor and hence a direct descendant of Isildur, Amlaith should by right have succeeded his father to become the eleventh King of Arnor and lord of all the Dúnedain of the North. After Eärendur's death, however, Amlaith fell into dispute with his younger brothers, and the descent of the Kingship was interrupted. The details of the brothers' disagreements are nowhere recorded, but their result was of historical significance, causing the old North-kingdom of the Dúnedain to be split into three realms. Amlaith's realm was reduced to the lands west of the River Baranduin and the Weather Hills, a region that came to be known as Arthedain. The eastern lands of Arnor were divided between Amlaith's brothers, creating the new kingdoms of Rhudaur to the north and Cardolan to the south.[2]
Whatever the cause of the dissension between Amlaith and his brothers, the fact of his direct descent from Isildur was never in question. Through Amlaith, the Kings of Arthedain carried the bloodline of Elendil down through the generations. Amlaith broke with the traditions of his forefathers and did not take a name in Quenya the High Tongue of the Elves. He ruled for eighty-five years and was succeeded at his death in TA 946 by his son Beleg.[3]

Etymology
Amlaith is a Sindarin word.[1]

Arveleg I was the eighth King of Arthedain.

Contents[show]
 Biography 
The beginning and the end of the Arveleg's reign were forged in battle and in war. He came to the throne in TA 1356 when his father Argeleb I went to war against the newly allied lands of Rhudaur and Angmar, and was slain. Arveleg swiftly struck back with the combined forces of the Men of Cardolan and the Elves of Lindon and drove back the invading hordes for a time. For more than fifty years, Arveleg maintained a constant guard stretching from the Weather Hills, along the Great East Road, to the lower reaches of the river Hoarwell. Due in large to the defensive prowess of the Men of Arthedain and Cardolan, Angmar was temporarily pushed back and besieged Rivendell.
It was not until TA 1409 that Angmar gathered its forces and was able to breach the frontier. Crossing the River Hoarwell, its armies marched westward and surrounded Weathertop. Arveleg and many of the defenders were slain and the watchtower was burned and razed. The surviving Dúnedain were able to save the Palantír of Amon Sûl and retreated to the capital city of Fornost. After this Rhudaur was fully occupied by evil men subject to Angmar and those of Númenórean blood, who still remained there were slain or fled west. Cardolan was ravaged.
Arveleg was one-hundred years of age when he died in TA 1409 after ruling for fifty-three years, and was succeeded by his not yet full-grown son Araphor.[2]

Etymology
The name Arveleg means ""Mighty-king"", from the Sindarin words ar(a) (""royal, noble, high"") and beleg (""mighty, strong"").[3][4]

Dúnedain of the North (House of Isildur)



Araphor was the ninth King of Arthedain.

Contents[show]
 Biography 
Araphor was the son of Arveleg I and came early to the throne of Arthedain. While he was still in his youth (probably no more than eighteen years old), the Witch-king of Angmar launched a mighty invasion of his kingdom, that came close to destroying it. Araphor's father Arveleg fought in the defence of the Tower of Amon Sûl, and his early death in that battle brought Araphor to the throne.
Records of the events of this time are incomplete, but it seems that the Witch-king laid siege to the royal city of Fornost. The young Araphor went to war with aid from Círdan and the Elves of Lindon, and succeeded in relieving the siege and driving back the forces of Angmar.
After Araphor's defeat of Angmar, there is no record of further warfare during his long reign. Nonetheless, he ruled a diminished and dwindling people; the wars of his youth had seen the Northern Dúnedain come close to destruction. Rhudaur was now a tributary state to Angmar, and the Dúnedain of Cardolan were all but extinct.
During these wars many Stoors (Hobbits) fled from Eriador and returned to Wilderland, and became the river people of Sméagol and Déagol.
Araphor died in TA 1589 after ruling Arthedain for one hundred and eighty years, and was succeeded by his son, named for Araphor's heroic grandfather Argeleb, who ruled as Argeleb II.[2]

 Etymology 
Araphor means ""Royal Fist"", from the Sindarin words ar(a) (""noble, high, royal) and paur[note 1] (""fist, closed hand"").[3][4]

 Biography 
Arvegil was born in TA 1553. During his father's reign, Arvegil saw events that would shape the history of Middle-earth, including the foundation of the Shire. He was eighty-three years old (no great age for one of the Dúnedain) when the Great Plague came out of the south and ravaged Eriador, but the seat of the Kings at Fornost in the north was little affected.
Arvegil lived for one hundred and ninety years, longer than any of his descendants until Aragorn, as is noted in the Appendices to The Lord of the Rings. By the standards of his own ancestors, though, this was an early death. Of all the northern Kings before Arvegil - excepting those slain in battle - only two had lived less than two hundred years: his father Argeleb II and his grandfather Araphor.
Arvegil died in TA 1743 after ruling Arthedain for seventy-three years, and was succeeded by his son, who ruled as Arveleg II.[2][1]

 Etymology 
The name Arvegil comes from the Sindarin words ar(a) (""noble, high, royal"") and megil or later vegil[3] (""sword"").[4]

 Biography 
He came to the throne in TA 1743 at the death of his father. During his rule the Great Plague was at its full strength in Eriador, and most of the people of Cardolan perished, especially in Minhiriath. The Hobbits and other peoples living in Arnor all suffered greatly, but the plague lessened as it went north, and the north of Arthedain was scarcely affected.
Still it saw the end of Cardolan, and the last prince of Cardolan was buried in the Barrowdowns in the same mound Frodo Baggins was later caught in. Evil spirits sent by Angmar passed through Rhudaur to Cardolan, and began to dwell in the Barrowdowns.
Perhaps because of the loss of population, he granted the Shire to the Hobbits. Before these lands had been a the royal hunting grounds. Argeleb was succeeded at his death in TA 1813 by his son Araval after ruling for seventy-years.[2]

 Etymology 
The name Arveleg means ""Mighty-king"", from the Sindarin words ar(a) (""royal, noble, high"") and beleg (""mighty, strong"").[3][4] He was named after his great-great-grandfather Arveleg I.

Dúnedain of the North (House of Isildur)



Araval was the thirteenth king of Arthedain.[1]

Contents[show]
 Biography 
He was the son of Arveleg II and was born into a time of war and strife. At the time of his birth, his father's realm of Arthedain had been under threat from the evil eastern land of Angmar for more than four hundred years.
Araval, too, played his part in the war with Angmar. The Lord of the Rings tells us nothing of his career, but it was hinted that he was a diplomat and a warrior.[1] In alliance with the Elves of Lindon and Rivendell, he won at least one important victory over the Witch-king of Angmar. We are also told that he attempted the recolonization of Cardolan, though this was prevented by the evil beings, the wights, sent there by the Witch-king some two centuries before.
In the end, though, Araval's bravery counted for little. His grandson Arvedui, who was born in Araval's lifetime and just thirteen years after his great victory, was to see the final destruction of the kingdom of Arthedain.
Araval died in TA 1891 after ruling Arthedain for seventy-eight years and was succeeded by his son Araphant.[1]

 Etymology 
The name Araval may mean ""Powerful King"", from the Sindarin words ar(a) (""king, noble, royal"") and bal or balch (""have power"").[3]

 Earlier names 
In the earlier version of the legendarium, his name was Arvallen[1] (""Golden King""), from ar(a) and mallen (""gold"").[4]

Dúnedain of the North (Rangers of the North)



Arahael was the first of Isildur's Heirs to be born after the destruction of the North-kingdom. His father Aranarth therefore gave him over to Elrond while he dwelt in the wild, to be fostered in Rivendell, and this became the custom of the Chieftains of the North.

Contents[show]
 Biography 
Arahael became the first chieftain in TA 2106.[1] Some decades before Arahael assumed the leadership of his people, Gandalf had gone to Dol Guldur and driven its master into the east. The Witch-king, who had ravaged the realm of Arahael's grandfather Arvedui two generations before, was far to the south in Minas Morgul. So, Arahael led the Dúnedain during the time known as the Watchful Peace, and was untroubled by war.
Arahael died in TA 2177 after serving as Chieftain for seventy-one years. He was succeeded by his son Aranuir.[2]

 Etymology 
Arahael is a Sindarin word that means ""Wise King"", from the prefix -ara (""king"") and hael or sael (""wise"").[3]

 Biography 
Aranuir was the son of Arahael and great-grandson of Arvedui Last-King. He was the direct ancestor of Aragorn Elessar through thirteen generations. Aranuir died in TA 2247.[2] Little is recorded on Aranuir's life or reign but it could be assumed that it was relatively uneventful.

Etymology
Aranuir possibly means ""Eternal King"", from the Sindarin aran (""king"") and uir (""eternity"").[3]

Contents[show]
 Biography 
He was raised by Elrond in Rivendell while his father Aranuir dwelt in the wild. At his father's death in TA 2247, Aravir in turn became the Chieftain of the Dúnedain. During his rule the Watchful Peace slowly came to an end as Sauron returned to the north-west of Middle-earth, although his presence remained unknown.
Aravir died in TA 2319 after serving as Chieftain seventy-two years, and was followed by his son Aragorn I.[2]

 Etymology 
His name means ""Noble Jewel"", from the Sindarin ara (""king, noble"") and mir or vir (""jewel"").[3]

Arahad I was the seventh Chieftain of the Dúnedain.

Contents[show]
 Biography 
Like his forefathers, Arahad was raised by Elrond in Rivendell while his father Araglas dwelt in the wild. He became the Chieftain of the Dúnedain in TA 2455 at the death of his father. During his rule as chieftain, it was discovered that Sauron had returned to Dol Guldur, and the Watchful Peace came to an end in TA 2460. In Rivendell, the White Council was formed, of which he became a member, together with the Wizards and many Elf-lords.[3]
Some time later the Misty Mountains were once again invaded by the Orcs. Elrond's wife Celebrian was taken by Orcs and tortured. She later left Middle-earth for Valinor. Arahad died in TA 2523 after serving as chieftain for sixty-eight years, and was followed by his son Aragost.[2]

 Etymology 
Arahad is a Sindarin name that is composed of ara (""king, noble"")[4] and had (""hurl, throw"").

Aragost was the eighth Chieftain of the Dúnedain.

Contents[show]
 Biography 
Like his forefathers, Aragost was raised by Elrond in Rivendell while his father Arahad I dwelt in the wild. He became the Chieftain of the Dúnedain in TA 2523 at the death of his father. His rule was an uneventful one, as the attention of the enemy was focused on Gondor, where the Éothéod had settled the new realm of Rohan.
He died in TA 2588[2], after serving as chieftain for sixty-five years, and was succeeded by his son Aravorn.

 Etymology 
In Sindarin, Aragost means ""Royal Dread"", from ara (""king, noble, royal"")[3] and gost (""dread"").[4]
Arandost was a former name until it was changed to Aragost on a later page of J.R.R. Tolkien's manuscript on the subject.[1]

Aravorn was the ninth Chieftain of the Dúnedain.

Contents[show]
 Biography 
Like his forefathers, Aravorn was raised by Elrond Half-elven in Rivendell. Aravorn became the Chieftain of the Dúnedain in the year TA 2588 at the death of his father. During Aravorn's rule, the Orc and Wolf attacks continued as the strength of the Dark Lord Sauron slowly began to increase. Aravorn died in the year TA 2654 after serving as chieftain for sixty-six years, and was followed by his son Arahad II.[2]

 Etymology 
In Sindarin, the name Aravorn has unclear origins. It is composed of the words aran (""king"")[3] and morn (""darkness, black""), which is later lenited to vorn.[4]

Contents[show]
 Biography 
Like his forefathers, Arahad was raised by Elrond in Rivendell while his father Aravorn dwelt in the wild. He became the Chieftain of the Dúnedain in TA 2654 at the death of his father. During his rule the Hobbits of the Shire prospered under the protection of the Rangers, and the first pipe-weed was planted in the Shire's Southfarthing. In the Shire, Isengrim II became the Thain and began digging the Great Smials. Arahad died in TA 2719[2] after serving as chieftain for sixty-five years, and was followed by his son Arassuil.

 Etymology 
Arahad was named for his great grandfather, Arahad I. His name is a Sindarin name that is composed of ara (""king, noble"")[3] and had (""hurl, throw"").

Arassuil was the eleventh Chieftain of the Dúnedain.

Contents[show]
 Biography 
Like his forefathers, Arassuil was raised by Elrond in Rivendell while his father Arahad II dwelt in the wild. After the death of his father in TA 2719, he became the eleventh Chieftain of the Dúnedain. During his rule, he fought off Orcs raids coming from the Misty Mountains and into Eriador. The Rangers fought hard trying to hold them off and were victorious[2], but there was nothing they could do about those that reached the Shire, where the hobbits were forced to fight off the dangerous enemy themselves under Bandobras Took.[3]
During his rule, a great and perilous Long Winter arrived in TA 2759 fell upon Eriador that took the lives of many. Gandalf and the Rangers had to help the Hobbits of the Shire live through it. Arassuil died in TA 2784 after serving as chieftain for sixty-five years, and was followed by his son Arathorn I.[2]

 Etymology 
Arassuil is a Sindarin word that meant 'royal-?'[4]

 Behind the Scenes 
Arasuil was a former name until it was corrected on a later page of J.R.R. Tolkien's manuscript on the subject.[1]

Arathorn I was the twelfth Chieftain of the Dúnedain.

Contents[show]
 Biography 
Like his forefathers, he was raised by Elrond in Rivendell while his father Arassuil dwelt in the wild. Arathorn became the Chieftain of the Dúnedain in TA 2784 at the death of his father. His rule was largely an uneventful one, as the Dúnedain and other peoples of Eriador were recovering from the Long Winter.
At the southern fringes of his realm, great events occurred: the Dwarven King Thrór was slain by Azog, an Orc of Moria. From TA 2793 – TA 2799 the War of the Dwarves and Orcs was fought all through the Misty Mountains, as Dwarves from all Seven Houses gathered to avenge Thrór, the Heir of Durin.
After the War ended in TA 2799 at the Battle of Azanulbizar, Eriador was safe from Orcs for many years, which meant that the Rangers of the North had a relatively safe period, aside from fighting the occasional Orc refugee. Most Orcs fled south to Rohan, trying to settle the White Mountains. Arathorn died in TA 2848 when he was attacked by Wolves, and he was followed by his son Argonui. He served as chieftain for sixty-five years.[2]

 Etymology 
Arathorn is a Sindarin word that meant 'royal-?'.[3]

Argonui was the thirteenth Chieftain of the Dúnedain.

Contents[show]
 Biography 
Like his forefathers, Argonui was raised by Elrond in Rivendell while his father Arathorn I dwelt in the wild. He became the Chieftain of the Dúnedain in TA 2848, when his father was killed by wolves. During his rule, Gandalf entered Dol Guldur and discovered that it was Sauron who ruled there as he long had feared, and not the Witch-king of Angmar his servant. Thráin II the Dwarf died after giving Gandalf a map and a key. The White Council met in TA 2850, where Gandalf urged an attack on Dol Guldur to drive Sauron out, but Saruman overruled him.
In TA 2890, Bilbo Baggins was born in the Shire, son of Bungo of the respectable Baggins family, and Beladonna, daughter of the Old Took. At the end of Argonui's rule in TA 2911 the Fell Winter began and White Wolves invaded Eriador from the North, some of them crossing the frozen river Baranduin into the Shire. Argonui died in TA 2912, possibly as a result of the Fell Winter, after sixty-four years and was followed by his son Arador.[2]

 Etymology

Culture
Dúnedain of the North (Rangers of the North)



Arathorn II was the fifteenth Chieftain of the Dúnedain and father of the future Heir of Isildur, Aragorn II Elessar.

Contents[show]
 Biography 
Like his forefathers, he was raised by Elrond in Rivendell while his father Arador dwelt in the wild. Arathorn asked for the hand of Gilraen at a very young age. Though her father Dírhael initially opposed the marriage, his wife prevailed upon him to agree to the match, as she foresaw that an early death awaited Arathorn.
Arathorn became the Chieftain of the Dúnedain in TA 2930, when his father was captured by Hill-trolls. He ruled for only three years until TA 2933,[1] when he was slain by an arrow that pierced his eye while hunting Orcs with Elladan and Elrohir. He was followed by his infant son Aragorn, also known as Elessar Telcontar.

 Portrayal in adaptations 
 Born of Hope 
In the fan work Born of Hope, Arathorn II is played by actor Christopher Dane. The only difference between the book and the film is that Arathorn is shot in the chest with an arrow and then has another arrow stabbed in the eye by an orc, compared to the book, where he is shot in the eye.

 Etymology 
Arathorn is a Sindarin name that meant either ""Eagle-king"" or ""Steadfast king.""[citation needed]","

He had three younger siblings: Tindómiel, Manwendil, and Atanalcar.
He had four children:

Tar-Amandil, eldest son who would succeed his father
Vardilmë, daughter
Aulendil, son
Nolondil, son[1]

Etymology

Tar-Amandil was the third King of Númenor.

Contents[show]
Biography
Tar-Amandil was actually Númenor's second ruler; his father, Vardamir Nólimon, had declined to take the throne upon the death of his father, Elros Tar-Minyatur. He abdicated due to advanced age in favor of his son Tar-Amandil but was still by right of succession the ruler, and Vardamir is still counted in the list of kings, making him the second king. Then, Tar-Amandil was the third King of Númenor. He had three children: Elendil, his eldest son who would succeed him, Eärendur, and a daughter named Mairen.[2]
Tar-Amandil surrendered the Sceptre of Númenor in SA 590 and was succeeded by his own son, Tar-Elendil. He died in the year 603 of the Second Age at the age of 411.[1]

Etymology
Amandil is a Quenya word that meant ""Friend of Aman"" or perhaps ""Devoted to Aman"" from Aman and ndil (""friend"").[3]

Tar-Anárion was the eighth King of Númenor.

Contents[show]
Biography
Tar-Anárion  succeeded his mother, Tar-Ancalimë in SA 1280. Little is known about Tar-Anárion's rule. His two eldest children were female, but both declined the throne for uncertain reasons, and they disliked and feared Ancalimë, who refused to let them marry. Therefore he was succeeded by his son, Tar-Súrion.[2]

Etymology
Anárion means ""Sun-son"" or ""Child of the Sun"" from the Quenya anar (""sun"") and -ion (""son, descendant of"").[3]

Erendis, also known as The Mariner’s Wife, was the unhappy and later estranged wife of Tar-Aldarion, who was King of Númenor from SA 883 to SA 1075.

Contents[show]
 Biography 
Erendis was born to Beregar and Núneth, who were descended from a minor branch in the Númenorean nobility of the House of Bëor. This was a lineage of lesser status then that of the royal house, thus enforcing a shorter lifespan upon her. She and her parents lived in the Númenorean land Emerië, a region she loved dearly.
She was in love with Aldarion for a long while before marrying him. They were betrothed in SA 858 and were finally married in SA 870 and had one child in the spring of SA 873, a daughter they named Ancalimë, the future Tar-Ancalimë who was the first of the Ruling Queens of Númenor. It seemed to Erendis that Aldarion was always away from her, and that she never had enough time with him before he went on another voyage. Aldarion was often late returning from his seafaring, which caused Erendis to suffer. Finally, Erendis became estranged from her husband, so great was her unhappiness with him.
She took her daughter to be raised on her farm in the countryside of her beloved land of Emerië. When Aldarion finally returned, he made decreed that his daughter be returned from her place of dwelling to live with him in Armenelos. Erendis grudgingly did as he commanded, but out of pride she never returned to him, and they were all but divorced SA 882. In SA 985, when she heard that Tar-Aldarion was returning from his last voyage, she apparently drowned herself in the Bay of Rómenna.[2][1]

    Erendis looking out at the sea, by Losse Elda  
 Etymology 
Although there appears to be no definitive meaning, the name Erendis may have originated from the Ñoldorin words er (""one, alone"") and dîs (""bride""), which would be prophetic for the unfortunate events of her life.[3]
Her Quenyan name was Tar-Elestirnë, meaning ""Lady of the Star-brow"", because of the white gem she set in a silver fillet which Aldarion bound to her forehead. She wore it for many years.[1]

Númenórean (King's Men)



Tar-Calmacil was the eighteenth ruler of Númenor. He succeeded his father, Tar-Alcarin, as king. His name means ""Bright Sword"", which he took in recognition of the territorial victories he had in Middle-earth as a renowned captain of Númenor.[1]

Contents[show]
 Biography 
Tar-Calmacil was also as the first king to have recorded an Adûnaic equivalent of his name: Ar-Belzagar.[1] This small but noticeable beginning of a separation between the Men of Númenor and the Elves signalled the rise of a faction known as the King's Men who were opposed to the Ban of the Valar.

 Other versions of the legendarium 
There is a discrepancy in Tolkien's writings as to Tar-Calmacil's successor: Tar-Ardamin, his son, or Ar-Adûnakhôr, his grandson. Specifically, in Appendix A of The Lord of the Rings, Ar-Adûnakhôr is listed as his successor, but in the more expanded ""Line of Elros: Kings of Númenor"" from Unfinished Tales, he is succeeded by Tar-Ardamin.

Mablung, also known as Mablung of the Heavy Hand, was a Sindarin elf who served in the army of King Elu Thingol of Doriath, as a captain and marchwarden.

Contents[show]
 Biography 
Mablung, along with Daeron, came to the Mereth Aderthad bearing gifts and friendship from Doriath.[1] He also served in Menegroth in some unknown position of command. Together with Beleg Cúthalion, he was one of the great captains of the Sindar, and were the only Elves of Doriath to fight with the Union of Maedhros in the Nirnaeth Arnoediad, as King Thingol would have nothing to do with the war.[2]
Mablung was was part of the Hunting of the Wolf together with King Thingol, Beleg, Huan and Beren, who later married Lúthien. During the fight with the wolf, Huan was killed and Beren mortally wounded. After the great beast is killed, Mablung was the one to slice open the wolf's belly and retrieve the silmaril. 
Mablung was present when Túrin fought with Saeros over his taunting and restrained Túrin's wrath to avoid a brawl in the King's hall. Mablung then attempted to stop Saeros from taking his threats too far and warned him of Túrin's strength, should he attempt to fight him. Aware that a fight had broken out between the two, Mablung was present at the final play in the drama and tried to stop things from ending badly. It was to no avail, as Saeros ran despairingly in fear and fell off a brink where a stream ran into the Esgalduin, and fatally broke his back on the rocks. Later, Mablung was present before Thingol's throne where he accounted for everything that had gone on between Saeros and Túrin, and later accounts of Túrin’s choice to leave Doriath.[3]
Mablung became captain of the guard of Doriath after Beleg left to seek Túrin. When Morwen Eledhwen, who dwelt in Doriath at the time, learned of the fall of Nargothrond and that her son Túrin might be there, she wished to seek him out. Mablung was assigned by Thingol to guard her on their way. Unknown to both Mablung and Morwen until too late, Nienor daughter of Morwen, had joined them. Mablung was unable to prevent them both from being ensnared in the traps of Glaurung, the dragon of Morgoth. Mablung hid from Glaurung and then searched the sacked Nargothrond, finding no sign of Túrin. 
Nienor was found again by Mablung, in a trance, by the spell of Glaurung, at Amon Ethir. Mablung then led her back to Doriath, but he later lost her again when she ran off unclad started by a band of Orcs; a result of the spell of Glaurung. Thus she fled beyond the sight of Mablung. Unable to recover her Mablung returned to Doriath, but he spent years afterwards searching for Morwen and Nienor.[4]
Mablung went to Brethil when he learned Glaurung was there, and there met Túrin. By admitting Nienor was lost he caused Túrin to realize that Níniel his wife had actually been his sister Nienor and Túrin killed himself.[5]
Mablung was the last person to whom Melian spoke before departing Middle-earth. She warned him about Thingol's Silmaril and to send word to Beren and Lúthien. Soon after Mablung was killed before the doors of the treasury during the Sack of Menegroth by the Dwarves of Nogrod.[6]

Etymology
The name Mablung is a Sindarin word that means Heavy Hand. It was probably not his real name, but an epessë (honorary title). His real name is unknown.[7]

Pallando (Quenya; IPA: [palˈlando]), also known as Pallando the Blue, or Rómestámo (Quenya; [ˌroːmesˈtaːmo]), was one of the five Istari or Wizards that were sent to Middle-earth to aid the Free Peoples in their struggle against Sauron.

Contents[show]
 Biography 
Before he came to Middle-earth, Pallando was a Maia of Oromë the Huntsman. He was taken to Middle-earth at the bidding of Alatar, another Istar who took him as a friend.
Pallando and Alatar (known as the Blue Wizards for their sea-blue robes) traveled to the east of Middle-earth with Curumo (Saruman the White) to aid some men and subdue others, primarily the Easterlings and Southrons who worshiped Sauron, and whose numbers were steadily increasing. Saruman later returned to the West, but Pallando along with Alatar stayed behind.
Other than this, not much is positively known about Pallando or Alatar, but it is thought that Pallando most likely failed his mission eventually. However, in Tolkien's later years he provided an alternate name for the wizard, Rómestámo, meaning ""helper of the East"". Here it is thought that rather than fail his mission altogether, Pallando perhaps had the opposite fate, and he and Alatar may have in fact played some crucial role in the War of the Ring and in the victory of the Army of the West, unnoticed but significant.[1]

 Character 
When Pallando came to Middle-earth, he was clothed in flesh and had the appearance of a wizened old man, though he did not look as old as Gandalf. He, along with Alatar, was dressed in robes of sea-blue, which is why they both came to be known as ""the Blue Wizards"" or Ithryn Luin.[1] Pallando had a grey beard which was not as long as either Gandalf's or Saruman's. He carried a staff, as did the other Istari, which he could use to channel his magical powers.

 Portrayal in adaptations 
 The Hobbit trilogy 
When talking to Bilbo, Gandalf mentions the two Blue Wizards in The Hobbit: An Unexpected Journey. When Bilbo asks how many Wizards there are, Gandalf states that there is himself, Saruman, the two Blue Wizards (whose names he has ""quite forgotten""), and Radagast.

Figwit is the fan-derived name for an unnamed Elf extra in The Lord of the Rings movies.

Contents[show]
 Portrayal in adaptations 
 The Lord of the Rings film trilogy 
    Figwit at the Council of Elrond  Figwit is seen in the first movie during the council of Elrond. He sits next to Aragorn until they all stand up to argue. After Frodo shouts ""I will take it!"" and everyone turns and looks at him, Figwit is standing on the far right. He is standing in the background for only a fraction of a second; thus few know who he is. 
Figwit is also seen in the third movie in the scene where Arwen is leaving for the Grey Havens and has the vision about her future son Eldarion. Figwit is the elf that tells her to continue with the others. His exact words: ""Lady Arwen, we cannot delay"" and then ""My lady!""[1]

 Behind the scenes 
Figwit's rise to fame began shortly after the first movie. Peter Jackson stated in the DVD commentary for ROTK that he was given dialog in the third movie because Jackson became aware of the attention given to this extra. Jackson mentions the phenomenon in the commentary track on the extended version of the Return of the King DVD: ""the decision to give him a speaking role was developed after the scene was scripted. Originally just a random cast extra was to give the lines, but it was decided that it would be fun if the Figwit actor was brought in to deliver them.""
Figwit does not appear in any of the books and was created exclusively by Peter Jackson. Because of this, there is little authentic information regarding Figwit, save that he was an escort (Peter Jackson refers to the name ""Figwit"" in one of the commentaries of Return of the King). The only 'official' place where the name ""Figwit"" actually appears is on a Return of the King series card from Topps #38 - ""Return to Rivendell"". The front of the card features a profile view of Figwit with the back text reading: ""Front: The Elf Figwit (Bret McKenzie) reminds her that they must go on the ships, but the determined Arwen simply rides off without explanation.""  Figwit's card in the Lord of the Rings collectable card game gives his name as Aegnor, the name of one of Galadriel's brothers in the Silmarillion.
""Figwit"" is played by Bret McKenzie (son of actor Peter McKenzie, who played Elendil in the first film) and is credited simply as ""Elf Escort"" in The Return of the King.
In 2004, a 50 minute documentary on the Figwit phenomenon ""Frodo is great... Who is that?!!"" was made by three Wellington filmmakers Stan Alley, Nick Booth and Hannah Clarke, all of whom worked on the Lord of the Rings trilogy. The documentary follows Bret McKenzie to the Edinburgh Fringe Festival where he meets the fans of his trademark pout and ""elvish good looks"" and features extensive interviews with fans behind various Figwit fan sites as well as Peter Jackson, Barry Osbourne, Mark Ordesky, Ian McKellen and other cast members.
Bret McKenzie returns in The Hobbit trilogy, playing the role of the Elf Lindir. McKenzie himself stated that he believed the two roles of Figwit and Lindir are two separate Elves, due to their different costumes, ears and hairstyles.

 Name 
The name ""Figwit"" is an acronym for ""Frodo is great; who is that?""
Figwit has become a popular character in fanfiction. However, many authors decided that “Figwit” didn’t sound nearly elvish enough. So they did their best to translate his name into an elvish language. They split it up, and combined the literal translation of “fig” (in Quenyan, “melpo”) and clever or skilled; “wit""[15] (in Noldorin, “maen”), and thus started using the name “Melpomaen” for his character
His decipher card gives the name Aegnor, a name derived from The Silmarillion.

Haldir was an Elf of Lothlórien, probably a Silvan Elf, and a marchwarden who guarded the forest's northern borders. When the Fellowship of the Ring arrived in Lórien, he became their guide to Caras Galadhon. He and his companions wore grey, hooded cloaks and resided on platforms or ""flets"".
Haldir was accompanied by his brothers, Rúmil and Orophin, who interacted little with the Fellowship because they, unlike Haldir, spoke little of the Common Tongue. Haldir could speak it fluently, as he often travelled outside of Lothlórien. Little is known about his brothers.

Contents[show]
 Biography 
 Third Age 
    ""The Dwarf breathed so loudly we could have shot him in the dark.""  
On January 15, 3019, Haldir and fellow guards encountered the Fellowship near the Nimrodel in the eaves of the forest. Haldir was able to speak to the Fellowship, for he knew the Common Tongue. He welcomed Legolas as a distant kinsman from the north (Mirkwood), and recognized Aragorn as a friend to Lady Galadriel. He was prepared to lead the Fellowship into Lórien, but hesitated upon learning that one of the party was a Dwarf. After consulting with his brothers, Haldir agreed that Gimli could enter if he went blindfolded. The fellowship then insisted that if one of them had to go blindfolded, they all would. The brothers reluctantly agreed, and then led them into the forest.[1]
They spent the night on a flet, or a platform in the trees. During the night, Haldir and his brothers heard Orcs passing and lured them away from the Fellowship. When he returned to the flet, Haldir saw a strange creature at the base of the tree, which Frodo guessed to be Gollum.
In the morning, Haldir fashioned a rope bridge for the Fellowship to use to cross the Silverlode. Haldir learned from Merry Brandybuck that the Grey Havens lay west of the Shire, and he spoke longingly of the sea, but sadly of the time when he and his kin would have to leave Lorien. When news came that the Fellowship's blindfolds could be removed, Haldir apologized to Gimli and welcomed him as the first Dwarf to enter Lórien since the time of Durin.
After guiding the Fellowship to Caras Galadhon, Haldir returned to his duties guarding the northern borders, but he returned when the Fellowship was about to depart to guide them to the banks of the Silverlode, where boats awaited them.[1]
Nothing further is known of Haldir's activities. It is likely that he participated in the defense of Lothlórien when the forces of Dol Guldur attacked it in March of 3019.
Haldir was one of the few Elves of Lórien who could speak Westron. He had clearly heard of Aragorn, but there is no indication that they had met previously.[2]

 Portrayal in adaptations 
 The Lord of the Rings film trilogy 
In Peter Jackson's film trilogy, Haldir was portrayed by Craig Parker in The Fellowship of the Ring and The Two Towers. A Weta Workshop miniature statue of the character rendition was made by Greg Tozer later, after 2013.

    Haldir fighting in Helm's Deep, on the Deeping Wall  
Haldir's role is greatly expanded in the films: In The Two Towers, he was sent by Elrond and led an army of five hundred elves from Lothlórien to Helm's Deep. They were stationed on the battlements and behind the Deeping Wall. They held off the Isengard assault until a bomb was set off and destroyed the walls. The elves, on Aragorn's command, charged straight into a wall of Uruk-hai pikes.

    Haldir meets his end  
During the breaching of the walls, the Rohirrim and Elves retreated to the Keep. As Haldir directed Elves to the Keep, he was surrounded and wounded by two Uruks, and died in Aragorn's arms after slaying one of them.

 Differences between film and novel 
Haldir did not come to Helm's Deep at all in the novel. In Tolkien's account, there were no elves at Helm's Deep (aside from Legolas), and the Elves of Lórien were occupied in battles against forces out of Moria and Dol Guldur, which were only mentioned in passing. Although the half-elven brothers Elladan and Elrohir did turn up at Dunharrow, this was after the Battle of the Hornburg had ended. It is also doubtful that Haldir had the authority to command such a large group since he leads only a small group of border guards.
Although Haldir dies in the battle at Helm's Deep in the film, there is no mention of his death in any of Tolkien's published works. Haldir encountered the Fellowship between January 15 and February 16, 3019 and it is generally believed that he lived long before and after this period and may have passed into the West with many other Elves of Lórien.

Oropher was the father of Thranduil of Mirkwood and grandfather of Legolas, and the Sindarin King of the Silvan Elves of Greenwood the Great during the Second Age.[1]

Contents[show]
 Biography 
 First and Second Ages 
    Oropher with Thranduil, by Kazuki Mendou  
Oropher was one of the Sindar of Doriath.  After the War of Wrath, he declined to depart Middle-earth as many others did, and instead went over the Blue Mountains with his household. He eventually ended up in Greenwood the Great, where Silvan Elves of Nandorin descent lived, and he was taken by them as lord. His capital was at Amon Lanc.[1]
West of Oropher's realm was the realm of Lórinand across the Anduin, where Amdír, another Sindar, ruled over Silvan Elves. When Sauron returned to Middle-earth from the Downfall of Númenor and began to grow in power, Oropher's folk retreated north of the old Dwarf-Road, and later again north of the Mountains of Mirkwood, where they fortified themselves.[1]

 War of Last Alliance 
Before the War of the Last Alliance, Oropher and his folk left their capital at Amon Lanc and crossed Anduin to live with their kin in Lórinand. For another three times, he moved his people northward to Emyn Duir, the Mountains of Mirkwood. His retreat northwards was because of his desire to move ""out of range"" from the Dwarves of Khazad-dum.[2]
Though he and his people had little to do with the other peoples of Middle-earth, Oropher understood that there could be no lasting peace until Sauron was defeated. Oropher answered the summons for the Last Alliance of Elves and Men but marched as an independent army with Amdír, or Malgalad the then King of Lórien. He joined with Gil-galad's forces as they marched down the Anduin to Dagorlad. Oropher's company was lightly armed.[1]
In the Battle of Dagorlad, Oropher's company fought valiantly but he was slain with the greater part of his people when he, with King Amdír and his warriors, called an early charge upon the enemy, without orders from the Noldorin High-King Gil-galad. After Sauron was defeated, Thranduil, Oropher's son and heir, returned to Eryn Galen with the shattered remnants of the formerly grand army of his people, back north. Ever after it distressed Thranduil to even turn his gaze south to the direction, and memory, of the horrors of the War of the Last Alliance, in which his beloved father fell with many of their people. Nevertheless, while depleted, their army was still large enough that the orcs hiding in secret in the Misty Mountains did not dare attack them.[1]

 Etymology 
The name Oropher probably means ""Tall beech-tree"" from oro (""up, rise, high""). In Doriath, the term orn refers to trees, especially beeches. The terms pher or pheren both mean ""beech-tree"".[3][4]

Rúmil was a knowledgeable loremaster of the Ñoldor living in the city of Tirion, in Valinor.

Contents[show]
 Biography 
Rúmil was possibly born in Valinor, or was perhaps one of the firstborn. He thrived in Valinor, being the first to invent the art of writing down words with pen or brush on many different mediums: he invented the alphabet called Sarati (each letter being a Sarat). This alphabet was later expanded and perfected by Fëanor as the Tengwar. Rúmil was also a skilled linguist, and when the Teleri finally arrived in Valinor he was first to discover just how the Telerin language had changed from Common Eldarin compared to Quenya. He became part of an elvish culture of loremasters known as the Lambengolmor.
When the Ñoldor determined to return to Middle-earth in pursuit of Morgoth, Rúmil was among those who refused the summons of Fëanor, remaining in Tirion as one of the Ñoldor of Finarfin.[1]

 Etymology 
Rúmil is a Quenya word.[2] Its origin is not clear - it is possibly derived from rum, meaning 'a secret'.[citation needed]","

Amdír, also known as Malgalad[1], was an Elf of Doriath, the father of Amroth and King of Lothlórien.

 Biography 
Amdír was a Sindarin elf from Doriath who left east into Eriador after the War of Wrath. He took over the realm of Lórinand (later Lórien) from the Silvan Elves, south of where Oropher established the Woodland Realm among the Silvan Elves of Mirkwood.
Amdír and Oropher joined Gil-galad's forces when he crossed the Misty Mountains and took the help of the Longbeards of Moria in the War of the Last Alliance. He was killed in the Battle of Dagorlad alongside most of those who followed him. His son Amroth succeeded him as King of Lórien.[1]

Pengolodh (or Pengoloð) was a Loremaster of the Ñoldor who dwelt in Gondolin, to whom are attributed the Lhammas and other prominent linguistic texts from ancient Middle-earth.

Contents[show]
 Biography 
 First Age 
Pengolodh was born in Nevrast to a Ñoldorin lord and a Sindarin lady. Early tales about the Fall of Gondolin mention him as one of the lords of the city, and ruler of the Twin Folk of the Pillar and the Tower of Snow. As one of the ""Lambengolmor"", he was known as the Sage of the Ñoldor, and counted as the greatest Loremaster since Fëanor and Rúmil. He was also the tallest of the Elves of Gondolin.
Pengolodh escaped the sack of the city with Tuor and Idril's company of survivors, and followed them to the Mouths of Sirion. He is not further mentioned in writing, but since the Annals of Beleriand are attributed to him, as well as the edited Annals of Aman (furthering the work of Rúmil), he must have stayed in Lindon for at least a while after the War of Wrath, so that the Dúnedain could copy his work.
It was during his stay at the Mouths of Sirion that Pengolodh did the majority of his work. Basing on information obtained from the refugees of Doriath, he made copies and extracts of documents written in Cirth, possibly preserving them as an active writing system.

 Second Age 
Later, in the Second Age, he lived in the Ñoldorin kingdom of Gil-galad in Lindon. Pengolodh was one of the few Elves admitted into Khazad-dûm, where he might have learned Khuzdul. Pengolodh left Middle-earth during the War of the Elves and Sauron and after the fall of Eregion, and left for Tol Eressëa, last of the Loremasters to leave Middle-earth. After removing himself to Tol Eressëa, Pengolodh dwelt in a village called Tavrobel (or Tathrobel). Centuries later, Ælfwine spoke with him there.[1]

 900 A.D 
When Ælfwine discovered the island of Tol Eressëa (c. 900 A.D.) he was told stories by Pengolod or studied his works (and those collected by Pengolod from other authors both elves and men) and translated them.
Pengolodh's collection also included the writings of Rúmil and Dírhavel.

 Canon 
Pengolodh's only appearance is in the The History of Middle-earth, where he is said to be the author of many works, including the Annals of Beleriand, a work which was developed by Tolkien at the same time as The Silmarillion, and from which Christopher Tolkien drew much information to establish the published Silmarillion. Various late essays by Tolkien dealing with linguism are presented as being the work of Pengolodh also, including the essay Quendi and Eldar.
Early Tolkien texts stated that, after Pengolodh moving to Tol Eressëa, the figure of Gilfanon, which fulfilled a similar role as a chronicler of the annals of Beleriand in earlier works, likely became this character as well in Tolkien's mind.[1]
Pengolodh (or by proxy Ælfwine) is the narrator for most of the materials that make up the published Silmarillion, either as the active story-teller/mentor teaching Ælfwine or via Ælfwine's translation of Pengolod's writings. In the final version, Christopher Tolkien removed most of the references to both of them.
Christopher Tolkien notes in The Peoples of Middle-earth that in the final version of Akallabêth, written by his father, the work is written in the voice of Pengolodh, and that the story was originally addressed to Ælfwine by him.

 The authentic text began:  ""Of Men, Ælfwine, it is said by the Eldar that they came into the world in the time of  the Shadow of Morgoth ...""

Christopher then admits that this removal made the whole source lose its anchorage in Eldarin lore, and he believed he used poor judgment and excessive vigilance, which also led him to alterations of the end of the paragraph (perhaps editorial work that was not his to properly make, as he went against his father's original intent). Christopher also points out that the last paragraph of Akallabêth, as published in The Silmarillion, still contains indirect references to Ælfwine, the 'straight road' and other 'future mariners', which he never altered or removed.

Etymology
The name Pengolodh has had many known spellings: Pengolod, Pengoloð, Pengoloth, and Pengoloþ—the ending in all cases representing the Voiced dental fricative. The name Pengolodh was a Sindarized form of his Quenya name Quendingoldo.[2]

Sindar (House of Elmo)



Elmo was the younger brother of Elwë and Olwë.

Contents[show]
 Biography 
Elmo was only mentioned in the Unfinished Tales in discussions on Galadriel and Celeborn because Celeborn was in The Silmarillion presented as a ""kinsman of Thingol"", and Tolkien wished to develop this family link. One of his solutions was to establish Celeborn as the grandson of Elmo, a non-important brother of Elwë who remained behind when Elwë was lost, becoming one of the Sindar of Doriath. In this conception Elmo had a son named Galadhon, who in turn sired Celeborn and another son named Galathil, who was the father of Queen Nimloth of Doriath.[1]
In writings which appear to be later than the one discussed above, Celeborn is made into a Telerin elf, and a relative of Olwë of Valinor instead, but this was not further developed or published.
It therefore remains uncertain if Elmo would have remained in the Middle-earth legendarium.

 Etymology 
The name Elmo has unclear origins. The first element el may mean ""star"", which is found in both Sindarin and Quenya. The second element mo, although does not seem to have any direct origin in Sindarin, may have come from the words môr or morn which means ""dark, black"".
In Quenya, -mo is a frequent ending in names and titles, sometimes with significance.

Nimloth was an Elf of Doriath during the First Age. She was the daughter of Galathil, son of Galadhon, the son of Elmo. Elmo was the brother of Olwë and Elwë, making her a kinswoman of King Thingol.

Contents[show]
 Biography 
Nimloth later married Dior the Fair, her second cousin, making her an heir of Melian, Queen of Doriath. In the few years before the death of Thingol, she lived near the land of Lanthir Lamath at the base of the Blue Mountains in the Northeast. There her children Eluréd, Elurín and Elwing were born.
When Thingol died, she went Northwest to Doriath with her husband and their children and became Queen of Doriath. She was later slain in the Kinslaying of Menegroth by the Sons of Fëanor along with her husband. Elwing escaped to the Havens of Sirion but it is unknown whether her brothers survived or not. It is tradtion among the Nandor of Ossiriand that they were lead to safety by the birds and beasts after being abandoned in the forest by the servants of Celegorm.[2]

 Etymology 
In Sindarin, the name Nimloth means ""White flower"", from the words nim (""white"") and loth (""flower, blossom"").[3][4] Her name might also mean ""Pale blossom"".[5]

 Other versions of the legendarium 
In an earlier text, Nimloth was the sister of Celeborn, rather than his niece through his brother, Galathil.[1]

""Shire... Baggins...""
—Khamûl, to Farmer Maggot[1]

Khamûl was one of the nine Ringwraiths second to the Witch-king, in Middle-earth after Arnor was defeated. During the Third Age, he held Dol Guldur as Sauron's lieutenant. After the Witch-king was slain, he became the Lord of Nazgûl for a short period.[2]

Contents[show]
 Biography 
 Second Age 
    Khamûl the Easterling, by John Howe  
Khamûl was once a mortal man who ruled the lands of the East known as Rhûn. He received one of the nine Rings of Power from the Dark Lord Sauron and in time he was corrupted and became one of his servants.
He first appeared as one of the Nazgûl in SA 2251.[3]


 Third Age 
    Khamûl in the Shire, by Denis Gordeev  
In TA 2951, Sauron sent three Nazgûl to abide in Dol Guldur, and Khamûl commanded the fortress thereafter.[4][5][3]

 War of the Ring 
Khamûl was the Wraith who pursued the Hobbits to Bucklebury ferry in the Shire, and who asked Farmer Maggot for ""Baggins"" just before Frodo Baggins left Hobbiton.[1]
Khamûl also appeared in the Battle of the Pelennor Fields with the other Nazgûl, mounted on his Fellbeast and killing Gondor's soldiers at the beginning of the battle. After the Witch-king´s demise, he and the other seven lesser Nazgûl retreated to Mordor.[6]
Afterwards, Khamûl became the leader of the Nazgûl. He led them to the Battle of the Black Gate riding his Fellbeast, before they were attacked by the Eagles. The Nazgûl retreated when they sensed that Frodo claimed the Ring for himself, and were lured towards Mount Doom. He fell by the eruption's fire.[7]

 Names 
Khamûl was called the Shadow of the East, the Second Chief, and the Black Easterling.[5] He was the only Ringwraith whose name was given by J.R.R. Tolkien, as well as one of the six Ringwraiths not of Númenorean descent.

 Portrayal in adaptations 
 Peter Jackson's film trilogy 
    The model for Khamûl's true appearance  
    Khamûl before he was corrupted, according to TheLandOfShadow.com  
In Peter Jackson's film adaptation of The Lord of the Rings trilogy, Khamûl was shown briefly when speaking to Farmer Maggot, who directs him onward to Hobbiton. Later, the Hobbits evade Farmer Maggot, but Frodo senses a presence and tells his friends to get off the road. Hiding behind a tree, the Hobbits hushed as Khamûl approached, catching their scent. As the four stayed quiet, Merry throws a sack of vegetables behind the Rider's horse, alarming Khamûl and causing him to leave the Hobbits undetected.
In The Return of the King, after the ring was destroyed, Khamûl died along with the seven other Ringwraiths in the eruption of Mount Doom, the Witch-king having perished earlier during the Battle of the Pelennor Fields.

 The Hobbit film trilogy 
    Concept art of Khamûl, as seen in The Hobbit films  
In the The Hobbit films, the nine Ringwraiths had been buried in the High Fells of Rhudaur, but emerged at the summons of the Necromancer, who is revealed to be Sauron. In the The Hobbit: The Battle of the Five Armies, Khamûl and the other eight Ringwraiths engaged the White Council in battle, with Khamûl wearing spectral ""Khaganate"" Easterling armor.

 Video games 
Though not named in the game, Khamûl was featured in The Lord of the Rings Online as the Lieutenant of Dol Guldur. He commands the forces of Sauron in Mirkwood and was the final boss of the 12-person raid on Barad Guldur, along with his fellbeast. 

He was once known as The Cursed Rider, as one of the Nine Nazgûl, he was the recipient of Orôm (Warmonger), one of the nine Rings of Power that were forged for Men. He was an Easterling King, but his name is lost in time, and he is now known by the most common of his many nicknames.

In Electronic Arts' The Battle for Middle-earth II: The Rise of the Witch-king, Khamûl is one of two named Ringwraith heroes of the Mordor faction who ride on fellbeasts.

 Pen & Paper RPGs 
In the Middle-Earth Role Playing Game, he is Khamul the Easterling. Khamul the Easterling 
was born Komul I in S.A. 1744 at Laeg Goak in eastern Endor. He was
the eldest son of Hionvor Mul Tanul of the Womaw. He was raised by the Lord' s Elven consort, Dardarian, who also served as his principal advisor until his ascent to the throne in S.A. 1844. Dardarian's influence upon the king of Womawas Drus corrupted
his outlook upon the world, and gave him a longing for the gift of immortality. Though he possessed Elven ancestry, it merely extended life for those of his lineage rather than continuing it indefinitely.
He found his own rule losing popularity among his own people in favor of Numenorean ambassadors. Since the Dunedain had established trade relations with the Womaw in S.A. 900, the influence from the Men of Westernesse increased over the years and grew to sway the populations of Womawas Drus' southern holdings. They built several fortified colonies, and diplomatically forced several concessions upon the part of Komul I's kingdom.
By S .A. 1 994, the internal stability of the Hionvor's rule was crumbling with many of the Womaw lords renouncing their loyalty to the King. Komul became a desperate man. With his entire kingdom collapsing about him, he turned to the only ally he knew: Dardarian.
He met with his stepmother at the Isle of Sunrises, where she seduced him with beauty, charm, and an enticing offer of immortality. Komiil was proud, desperate, and had a deep longing for immortality; he accepted her offer, and an alliance was formed between Dardarian's A var kingdom of Helkanen and the Womawas Drus. This alliance gave Komul the power to demand concessions from the Numenoreans the following year, quashing any thoughts of Dunadan conquest. The pact with Dardarian had many benefits, for it secured the Womaw kingdom from collapse. Unfortunately, it would spell the downfall for their Hionvor.
Dardarian served Sauron of Mordor and was charged with the duty of corrupting Komul. In S.A. 1 996, she delivered the item which would bestow the Womaw king with immortality. He accepted one of the Nine Rings of Power and fell under the sway of the Lord of the Rings. His reign over the Eastern Kingdom came to an abrupt end.
Komul disappeared early in the spring of S.A. 1997, after remaining virtually isolated from any other person. The Hionvor's apparent lack of interest sparked a bloody succession struggle for Komul's throne. Assassinations, spying, and intrigue marred the once peaceful court of the Womaw. Seeing that holding his power in the kingdom would be to no avail, he abdicated his throne to a Numenorean supported faction with his cousin Aon at the head. No one realized the true reasons for Komul's abdication, but it probably saved the kingdom from Sauron's iron grip. Komul could do nothing save swear an oath of vengeance upon his former court.
Komul's whereabouts from S.A. 1997-2000 remain unknown, but he appeared at the gates of the Dark Tower in S.A. 2000. His name became Khamul, as this was how it was pronounced in the Black Tongue. He was given the stewardship of Barad-dur, which he held until he was pushed out by Ar-Pharazon, he traveled to the east and corrupted several tribes there.
He alter returned to Mordor abiding in Nurn, during the War of the Ring, but did not take part until the fall of Dark Tower in 3441, when he and his Master came forth to fight the Elven host. He slew many, but disappeared into Shadow after Isildur cut off Sauron's ring. He remained in Shadow until he joined his master in Dol Goldur in 1050. Following that he spent some time further in the southeast fought the pressures of the corrupted Blue Wizards for control of the region, but it never panned out. In the 1600s he returned to Sauron in Dol Goldur, where he remained until the fall of the Watch of Mordor. He was sent along with seven lesser Nazghul to take back Mordor to prepare for their Master's return.
In 2063, he returned to his homeland to finish his millenia-old vow, and conquered it for the Shadow. Then he returned to Mordor at the same time as his Master. He spent time traveling between Mordor and Dol Guldur. During one of these journies he captured Thrain II, imprisoned him in Dol Goldur, took the dwarf's ring of power and tortured him. He never got information he wanted, and Thrain escaped to give Gandalf the key to Erebor. Sauron punished him for his failure but he still remained one of Sauron's four most powerful servants. Khamul fled with Sauron during White Council's attack 2941 and traveled to Mordor.
Khamul would later return to Dol Gondor and lead the forces there on the attacks of the people of the North.
He would later fall when he was called back to stop Frodo at Mount Doom, but perished when the ring was destroyed.
Khamûl is of the Avaradan (Half-Elves) kings, descended from Abar Elves, and the Womaw (same line as the Edain of Numenor).

In prior versions of the stories, Khamûl was stationed at Dol Guldur on March 6th, when Aragorn revealed himself to Sauron and began marching on the Wood-elf realms on March 10th. On March 11th, his forces began assailing the nearby Lórien. After this failed, much of his force passed around the border of the woods and entered the Wold of Rohan. On March 12th, they were met with Ents sent east from Fangorn and Isengard, and were routed. Lórien was then attacked twice more on March 15th and March 22nd, but was never entered. The forces of Dol Guldur also went north into Mirkwood, battling the forces of King Thranduil under Mirkwood's trees, the climax of these battles being on March 15, 3019 which after a ""long battle... and great ruin and fire"" was won by Thranduil's forces.

 Trivia 
Khamûl is the only Nazgûl whose true name is revealed.

Khîm was a Petty-dwarf, was the son of Mîm and brother of Ibûn.

 Biography 
He, his father, and his brother Ibûn were the last of the Petty-dwarves in Middle-earth. He was struck by an arrow fired by a member of Túrin's outlaw band when he and his family were set upon near their home at Amon Rûdh. Khîm escaped the attack but died of his wounds at Amon Rûdh before his father returned with Túrin and his men. Túrin promised to pay Mîm a ransom to atone for Khîm's death, and this was in part the source of Amon Rûdh's other name, the House of Ransom. Mîm cursed Khîm's killer, Andróg, forcing Andróg to break his bow.[1]

Gorlim was one of the companions of Barahir and his band of outlaws in Dorthonion.

Contents[show]
 Biography 
The tale of Beren and Lúthien in The Silmarillion describes how Barahir, last lord of the Men of Ladros in Dorthonion, remained as an outlaw in his own land after it was lost to the Dark Lords Morgoth and Sauron in the Dagor Bragollach.
Barahir had twelve companions, one of these Gorlim, son of Angrim, but all their kin were scattered or killed. As Barahir and companions were camping at a secret hide-out in southern Ladros, Gorlim went out hunting near the area where he once lived, when he suddenly saw his old house standing as it long had, and through the window he saw his presumably dead wife, Eilinel. He came out of hiding to go to her, when he was captured by Orcs from the Fortresses of Lord Sauron and Lord Morgoth.
Gorlim was brought before Sauron, who told Gorlim that in return for revealing where Barahir and his company were hiding he would be reunited with his beloved wife. Gorlim accepted the offer and Barahir and his company were betrayed. Then Sauron revealed that Gorlim had seen but a spectre devised by him, for his wife was already dead, but that he would keep his word and reunite Gorlim with his wife: he had Gorlim put to death.
After Sauron's Orc-warriors had slain all of Barahir's remaining men but for his son Beren, who was out hunting Orcs, Gorlim appeared as a spectre before Beren, and confessed what he had done, giving Beren a chance to reclaim the Ring of Barahir, heirloom of his house, and escape alive.[2][3][4]

 Other versions of the legendarium 
In an earlier version of the Lay of Leithian, it was Morgoth himself that tricked Gorlim into betraying Barahir and his company, not his lieutenant Sauron.[5][6]

Urwen, more commonly known as Lalaith, was an Edain child of the House of Hador, the second child of Húrin and Morwen Eledhwen and sister of Túrin Turambar during the First Age.

Contents[show]
 Biography 
Urwen was later named Lalaith after the Nen Lalaith, a stream that ran by Húrin's house in Dor-lómin, because she was a happy child and brought much joy to the hearts of the household of Húrin during her short life. Her hair was yellow like the lilies that grew in the grass and was compared to an Elven child by most people. Túrin loved his little sister but played with her seldom and liked better to guard her unseen as she ran and played with song, but she was killed by a plague which came to Hithlum from Angband when she was still an infant.
Túrin never got over her death and always looked for her likeness in women ever after, which is one possible reason for the tragedy which befell him when he took Nienor Níniel as a wife later.[4][5][6]

Etymology
Her birth name Urwen means ""Fire maiden"", from Sindarin words ur (""fire"") and -wen (""maiden""). On the other hand, Lalaith means ""laughter"".[7]

House of Hador


The House of Hador was previously known as the House of Marach.

","In Middle-earth folklore the Man in the Moon is described as being an old being who secretly hid on the island of the Moon, and built his minaret there. Combined with the Elven lore, as presented in the legendarium of The Silmarillion, the Man in the Moon of the Hobbits' tales must have his origins in the legend of Tilion the Maia. 
This is alluded to further in Tolkien's Roverandom, where the Man in the Moon also lives in a Minaret. 
In The Book of Lost Tales, his name is given as Uolë Kúvion, but the tale of how he came to live there was never fully told.

""He's dead. Took a little tumble off the cliff.""
—Sharku to Legolas and Gimli, about Aragorn

Sharku was the veteran Orc from Isengard leading Saruman's Warg-Riders. He only appears in the film adaptation of The Two Towers.

Contents[show]
 Portrayal in adaptations 
 Peter Jackson's The Two Towers 
    Sharku during the attack on Rohan  
Saruman's nickname ""Sharkey"" was stated in a footnote to be a corruption of the word 'sharku'.
In the second film of Peter Jackson's film trilogy, Sharku is sent by Saruman with a large group of Isengard Orcs on Wargs to attack the people of Rohan who are trying to reach the fortress of Helm's Deep. Aragorn has a short struggle with Sharku on his warg, where, as Sharku tries to knock him off the Warg, Sharku is stabbed in the chest by Aragorn's Elven knife. The Warg, in an attempt to throw Aragorn off, gallops towards the ledge of a cliff. Sharku then falls off his Warg and is trampled. Aragorn becomes stuck to the Warg's saddle and tumbles to his supposed death. Unable to find Aragorn, Legolas and Gimli threaten a dying Sharku who reveals Aragorn's fate before expiring. 
He was acted by Peter Jackson's friend Jed Brophy. 

 Video games 
    Sharku in The Lord of the Rings: The Battle for Middle-earth II.  
Sharku appears in the The Two Towers video game and in The Lord of the Rings: The Third Age. He is also a hero in the game Battle for Middle-earth II for the Isengard faction.
Shown in the Top Trumps card game, Sharku is said to have been 5,000 years old and a veteran of the Goblin Wars, though this is not canon.

Horse



Nahar was the horse of Oromë the Vala. Nahar was said to be as brilliant as new snow in daylight, and as glimmering as silver in the moonlight.
Before the elves awoke in Middle-earth, Oromë rode Nahar through its great forests. After the awakening of the elves, it was said that if they strayed too far from their encampment, they risked being captured by a strange rider. This was one of Melkor's schemes. The elves thought that a captured elf would be brought to Utumno and tortured. One day, as Oromë was riding through the forest, he came upon the elves. He, realizing the elves had awakened, urged them to journey to Valinor. At first, they feared this strange being, as they believed him to be the rider that would lead them to torment and death; however, Ingwë, Finwë, and Elwë (who would later become Elu Thingol, king of Doriath) rode with Oromë back to Valinor [1] It could be from Nahar that the Mearas were descended this would mean that Felaróf would be his descendant and Shadowfax would be his distant descendant.

Beechbone was one of the younger Ents who lived in Fangorn Forest, and was said to be a very tall and handsome Ent.

 Biography 
Little is known of Beechbone, except that that he took part in the Destruction of Isengard with the other Ents on March 3, 3019. He was caught on fire there by gas let out by the vents of Isengard, and apparently burned to death. However, this even further angered the other Ents, rousing them to finish destroying Isengard.[1]

 Portrayal in adaptions 
 The Lord of the Rings film trilogy 
In Peter Jackson's film adaptation, an Ent presumed to be Beechbone is briefly seen being set on fire by Orcs using flaming arrows. He survives, however, by extinguishing himself in the flood caused by the dam being broken.

    Leaflock as shown in Peter Jackson's films  Finglas (Sindarin for 'hair-leaf'), known in Westron as Leaflock, was an Ent of Fangorn Forest.
Finglas was one of three oldest Ents still living during the end of the Third Age. He, Skinbark, and Treebeard were the only ones left of the first and eldest of the Ents in Middle-earth. By the time of the War of the Ring, Finglas had become sleepy and ""treeish"" (dormant and inanimate, like a tree). He stood alone in a meadow and dozed during the summer. At first he would awake in wintertime, but eventually he remained in place year-round, preferring to remain dormant to avoid the troubles of the world.[1]

Contents[show]
 Description 
Finglas is described as a large, abundantly-leafed tree, short, and stout of heart. He had very round feet with seven stubby toes, and could step on Orc-foes easily. There was not much more written about him, as he is not a recurring character.

 Portrayal in adaptations 
    Leaflock from The Lord of the Rings Online  
In Peter Jackson's The Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers, Leaflock is portrayed as a very large, thick, and oak-like Ent. He helps besiege Isengard, and put out the furnace fires of the industrial devilry of Saruman below Orthanc. He is notably seen landing on top of two Orcs, crushing and killing them instantly at the start of the siege and ""smacking"" two Orcs (not Uruk-hai) together some time later.
He also appears in The Lord of the Rings Online, where he can be interacted with in Fangorn forest.

Fladrif, also known as Skinbark, was an ent of Fangorn Forest, and was one of the first Ents in Middle-earth. By the end of the Third Age, only he, Leaflock, and Treebeard remained of the original Ents.[1]
Skinbark lived on the mountain slopes west of Isengard. Saruman's Orcs ravaged this area, cutting down trees and killing Ents. Skinbark was wounded by the orcs and retreated far up the mountain slopes to live among the birches that he favored, refusing to come down.[1]

 Portrayal in adaptations 
Skinbark appears in Peter Jackson's The Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers along with many other ents of Fangorn Forest. Unlike the book, he is shown to participate in the Entmoot called by Treebeard, and later in the Destruction of Isengard, where he is seen crushing dozens of orcs by rolling a boulder.

Tar-Alcarin was the seventeenth King of Númenor.[1]

Contents[show]
 Biography 
Tar-Alcarin was the son of ruling Queen, Tar-Vanimeldë, and her consort, Herucalmo. When his mother died, Tar-Alcarin should have succeeded his mother upon her death, but Herucalmo usurped the throne and held it from him twenty years before he died, and then Tar-Alcarin rightfully gained the throne. He ruled during a period in which there was still peace in Númenor despite the beliefs of The Faithful and the King's Men which divided its people. However in Middle-earth things were very different, Sauron's power begins to grow once again setting great fear on its lands east of Mordor. Herucalmo's usurping of his legal right to rule the realm was generally considered to be an evil deed by the people.
Tar-Alcarin ruled for eighty years, then was succeeded by his son, Tar-Calmacil but was legally king and ruler of Númenor for the count of one-hundred years.[1][2]

 Etymology 
The name Alcarin means ""Glorious"" in Quenya.[3]

Carcharoth, also known as the Red Maw, lived in the First Age of the Sun, and was the greatest werewolf who ever lived. He was of the line of Draugluin.

Contents[show]
 Biography 
Carcharoth was created as a defence against Huan, and was reared by Morgoth's own hands on living flesh and filled with great power. So Carcharoth, who was also named Anfauglir (IPA: /anˈfaʊglir/), the 'Jaws of Thirst', grew to great size and his strength seemed beyond compare. His eyes burned like red coals and his teeth were poisoned as the spears of the Orcish legions. Carcharoth was the guardian of the gate of Angband and none could pass him by strength of body alone.
He became involved with the Quest for the Silmaril when Beren and Lúthien had to pass him on their way in. He espied them on their way in, and grew suspicious of Beren because he was disguised as Draugluin, who Carcharoth knew to be slain. Before he could take action against the pair, Lúthien enchanted him with her magic, sending him into a deep sleep. Unfortunately, on their way out Carcharoth awoke, and Lúthien was too weary to spell him again. Beren held out the captured Silmaril in an attempt to slay the beast, but Carcharoth was not daunted, and bit off Beren's hand at the wrist, Silmaril and all.
The Silmaril burnt away Carcharoth's insides, and he became crazed with pain, yet filled with great power. A terror to Eldar, Men and Orcs alike, he burst from Angband, slaying anything and everything in his path. He continued south through Beleriand, and eventually he arrived in Doriath. With the power of the Silmaril inside him, the Girdle of Melian had no effect on him, and his presence placed the entire kingdom in grave danger. To protect Doriath, Beren Erchamion, Elu Thingol, Beleg Cúthalion, and Mablung joined with Huan the Hound to track down and slay the Wolf.
Carcharoth was killed in single combat by Huan in FA 466, but both Huan and Beren were mortally wounded by the poison in Carcharoth's teeth. When Mablung cut open the wolf's belly, he found there the Silmaril with Beren's hand still closed around it, but when he touched the flesh it was swept away by a wind leaving only the great Jewel.[2]

 Behind the Scenes 
    Carcharoth battling Huan.  
The detail of Beren losing his hand to Carcharoth may be modelled after the Norse legend of the god Týr, who lost his hand to the wolf Fenrir.

 Other versions of the legendarium 
Originally Carcharoth's name was Karkaras, meaning the Knife-Fang. Karkaras was considered a father of wolves and initially bore a shape of a huge grey wolf.[3]
Another name for Carcharoth was Borosaith meaning Everhungry which was applied mostly in old songs.[4]

Herucalmo was the consort to the Ruling Queen Tar-Vanimeldë of Númenor.[1]

 Biography 
Herucalmo was ""much younger"" than his wife. Tar-Vanimeldë had little interest in ruling, and Herucalmo served as her regent taking over the duties of state. When she died, the throne should have gone to their son, Tar-Alcarin, but Herucalmo usurped the throne and ruled under the name Tar-Anducal (""Light of the West"") from SA 2637 to SA 2657. Being an illegal claim to the throne of Númenor, Herucalmo was not given the official title of King of Númenor.
Upon Tar-Anducal's death, Tar-Vanimeldë's son Tar-Alcarin finally succeeded to his rightful throne.[1]

Draugluin was the first werewolf to be bred by Morgoth during the First Age of Middle-earth.

Contents[show]
 Biography 
Draugluin was bred from the Wolves and imbued with an evil spirit sent by Morgoth himself.  Draugluin was a dreadful, old, and evil abomination and was the lord and sire of all werewolves of Beleriand, and dwelt with his master Sauron in Tol-in-Gaurhoth, the former watchtower of Finrod Felagund.
Draugluin was slain by Huan during the Quest for the Silmaril after a long battle, and Beren and Lúthien used his pelt to sneak into Angband.
Draugluin was the sire of Carcharoth and many other werewolves. It is probable the Wargs of the Third Age and the White Wolves were descended from him, as these wolves could speak, suggesting they had Fëar.[1]

 Etymology 
Draugluin means ""Blue wolf"" in Sindarin, from draug (""wolf"") and luin (""blue""). Drauglir was an earlier form of the name.[citation needed]","

Borondir, also known as Borondir Udalraph, was a Man of Gondor. 

Contents[show]
 Biography 
Borondir was a skilled rider from out of Minas Tirith, descended from the Northmen of Rhovanion who entered Gondor in the noontide of that realm. Borondir and five other messengers were charged with bringing Cirion's message requesting aid from the Éothéod led by Eorl the Young, the Lord of the Éothéod after Gondor was in danger of being overrun by the Balchoth, in TA 2509. His company set out on the tenth day of Súlimë with the Red Arrow and a stone bearing the Seal of the Stewards and rode north along the Anduin. All of his companions were slain save for him and after fifteen days without food, he finally came to Eorl on the twenty-fifth of Súlimë and delivered the message despite being weakened near to dead.
After recovering himself, he decided to ride with Eorl to war on the sixth day of Víressë.[1] He led a charge across the Limlight in aid of Cirion whom he died defending in the Battle of the Field of Celebrant. He deeds before and after the battle left him greatly mourned by both the Éothéod and Gondor and was laid to rest in the Hallows of Minas Tirith. He was remembered in the song Rochon Methestel.[2]

Etymology
The name Borondir means ""Steadfast Man"" (boron: ""steadfast, enduring"", dir: ""man""). His surname ""Udalraph"" means ""the stirrupless"", it refers to his qualities as a rider because he didn't need stirrups, whilst a normal rider of Gondor did.[2]

 Portrayals in adaptations 
In The Lord of the Rings Online Borondir briefly appears in a flashback narrating the history of the Eotheod.

Culture
Eagles of Valinor



Gwaihir, also known as Gwaihir the Windlord, was lord of the Great Eagles during the Third Age.

Contents[show]
 Biography 
Gwaihir was descended from Thorondor, the greatest Eagle who ever lived. It was said that he and his brother Landroval aided Thorondor in rescuing Beren and Luthien from Angband.[1]
At some point in his life, Gandalf the Grey saved him from a poisoned arrow.

 War of the Ring 
In the summer of TA 3018, Gandalf asked Radagast the Brown to send word among his friends the birds to learn what they could of the Enemy's plans. The Great Eagles flew far and wide and gathered news of the Nazgûl and the mustering of Orcs and Wargs, and of the escape of Gollum from Mirkwood.

    Gwaihir rescues Gandalf from Orthanc  
Gwaihir went to Isengard to bring this news to Gandalf. In the early hours of September 18, he found Gandalf imprisoned by Saruman on the pinnacle of Orthanc. Gwaihir bore Gandalf away, and when the Wizard said that he needed a horse, Gwaihir set him down in the land of Rohan.
On February 17, 3019, Gwaihir was searching for Gandalf at the request of Galadriel when he found the Wizard atop the Silvertine. Gandalf had vanquished the Balrog in the Battle of the Peak, but the entrance to the Endless Stair had been blocked and he had been unable to escape from the mountaintop. Gwaihir once again bore Gandalf and he found his burden to be as light as a feather, for Gandalf's old life had been burned away and he had been reborn as Gandalf the White.
The Eagle brought Gandalf to Lothlórien and then at the Wizard's request he flew to seek news of the Fellowship. Aragorn and Legolas both saw him circling above the Emyn Muil. Gwaihir returned to Gandalf with the news that Merry and Pippin had been kidnapped by Saruman's Uruk-hai.

    Gwaihir against a fell beast  
Gwaihir and his brother Landroval led a great company of Eagles to the Battle of the Black Gate on March 25, 3019. They swooped in to attack the Winged Nazgûl, but the Nazgûl fled when Sauron summoned them to fly to Mount Doom where Frodo Baggins stood at the Cracks of Doom with the Ring. After the Ring was destroyed, Mount Doom erupted and Frodo and Sam were stranded on a hill amid flowing lava and falling ash. Gandalf asked Gwaihir to bear him a final time. Accompanied by Landroval and Meneldor, Gwaihir raced swiftly to Mount Doom and with his keen sight, he spotted the Hobbits through the fumes. The Eagles lifted Frodo and Sam and bore them away to safety.

 Etymology 
The name Gwaihir comes from the Sindarin terms gwaew (""storm, wind"") and hîr (""lord, master""), translating his name to ""Wind-lord"".[2]

 Abilities 
Gwaihir had keen eyesight and was the swiftest of the Great Eagles. He was large and strong enough to carry a grown man, though not indefinitely.

 Other versions of the legendarium 
In earlier versions, his name was ""Gwaewar"" and he was Thorondor's (then leader of the Great Eagles) vassal. As Gwaewar, he  was called the ""Lord of the Wind"".[3] He was also among the Eagles present to save Beren and Lúthien from Angband.[4]
In TA 2941, a character called ""Lord of the Eagles"" saved Thorin and Company from Wargs and Orcs. He later arrived in the Lonely Mountain and fought in the Battle of Five Armies.[5]
However, it is up for debate if Gwaihir was one of the eagles that saved Thorin and Company. In the whole of The Lord of the Rings Gwaihir carries Gandalf twice, and by the end of the book Gandalf says so [6]; this implies that Gwaihir had not borne him before the years of The Fellowship of the Ring.

 Portrayal in adaptations 
 The Lord of the Rings film trilogy 
In The Fellowship of the Ring, Gwaihir arrives at Isengard to rescue Gandalf. Later in The Return of the King, Gwaihir, Landroval, and the other Great Eagles arrive at the Battle of the Black Gate and attack the Nazgûl and their fell beasts. After the destruction of the One Ring, Gwaihir bears Gandalf and rescues Frodo and Sam from the rocks of Mount Doom.
In the Hobbit Trilogy, Gandalf uses a moth to call Gwaihir and the other Great Eagles to help them escape Azog and his hunters. Later, Radagast rides Gwaihir during the Battle of the Five Armies after seeking his aid along with an army of Great Eagles.

 Video games 
Gwaihir makes a brief appearance in the video game The Lord of the Rings: The Third Age as a special power available to Berethor's Company.
Gwaihir makes an unnamed appearance in The Lord of the Rings: The Battle for Middle-earth as a power to use when playing as either Gondor or Rohan. Although he is unnamed - just called an eagle - it is possible that one of the eagles would be Gwaihir.
Gwaihir also makes a brief appearance in The Lord of the Rings: War in the North after Eredan, Andriel and Farin defeat Bargrisar.

Berúthiel was a Queen of Gondor in the Third Age before the reign of the Stewards.[1]

Contents[show]
 Biography 
Berúthiel was a Black Númenórean and the wife of Tarannon Falastur of Gondor. She was noted for being ""nefarious, solitary, and loveless"". It is therefore of no surprise that Tarannon died childless. She lived with her husband in Osgiliath but hated the sound and smell of the sea. She had ten cats under her service — nine black and one white, with whom she conversed and set as spies to the Men of Gondor. The white cat was used to spy on the black cats and act as their chief. Eventually, Tarannon exiled her from Gondor. He set her and her cats on a ship that was last seen past Umbar.
Her name was removed from the Books of the Kings but not from the memory of Men. Aragorn made mention of Berúthiel and her cats more than 2,000 years after her disappearance, referring to her cats as finding their way in the dark extremely well. [2]

 Behind the Scenes 
In an interview Tolkien had in 1966 he added the following information on her:

Well, Berúthiel went back to live in the inland city, and went to the bad (or returned to it she was a Black Númenórean in origin, I guess). She was one of these people, who loathe cats, but cats will jump on them and follow them about you know how sometimes they pursue people who hate them? I have a friend like that. I'm afraid she took to torturing them for amusement, but she kept some and used them: trained them to go on evil errands by night, to spy on her enemies or terrify them.

Piecing all this info together, it can be surmised that Berúthiel was a Black Númenórean from an unnamed Black Númenórean settlement south of Umbar (there were several, mentioned a couple of times but never mapped or named), and that Tarannon probably married her in an attempt to settle the feuds Gondor had with the more southern Númenórean realms in exile. Berúthiel probably returned home, and her expulsion from Gondor must have reignited hostilities between the Black Númenórean realms and Gondor, which eventually lead to the capture of Umbar in TA 933 after a new war.[3]

 Etymology 
The name Berúthiel was Sindarin, meaning ""Angry Queen"", from bereth (""queen""), ruth (""anger""), and the common feminine suffx -iel.

 History 
    An Olog-hai in full battle armour  
The Olog-hai are not mentioned by name in The Lord of the Rings; the term appears only in the appendices. They were bred by Sauron in the late Third Age, possibly for the same reason Saruman bred the Uruk-hai, for improvement and less vulnerability to sunlight. They lived primarily in Mordor and in southern Mirkwood. However, they are described as being in the Battle of the Black Gate, where Pippin saves his friend Beregond from one.
The Olog-hai are described as being taller than a Man, covered in spiky scales, carrying war hammers, large swords, or spiked maces, and bucklers, and having claws and, on occasion, tusks. It is mentioned that after the War of the Ring, all Olog-hai were killed.[1]

 Etymology 
Olog-hai was a Black Speech word that meant simply 'troll-folk'. They seldom spoke and never in any language other than the Black Tongue of Mordor.[1] 'Olog' meant 'troll' in Black speech and 'hai' meant 'folk’. [citation needed]","

Edain (House of Bëor)Men of Dorthonion, later Men of Brethil



Emeldir, also known as Emeldir the Manhearted, was an Edain woman of the House of Bëor. She was the daughter of Beren who was the son of Belemir of the House of Bëor and Adanel of the House of Marach. She had two unnamed elder siblings, making her the third child of Beren (son of Belemir).[2]
Contents[show]
 Biography 
Emeldir was the wife of Barahir who was also of the House of Bëor through the line of Baran, the eldest son of Bëor the Old.[2] Emeldir then bore Barahir only one child and son who was none other than the renowned Beren Erchamion also known as Beren the One-handed. Thus, naming her son after her father Beren, Belemir's son.
After the conquest of Dorthonion by the forces of Morgoth, and then after the ruin of the Dagor Bragollach, Emeldir's husband Barahir and her son Beren stayed behind in Dorthonion forming a band of outlaws. Emeldir however would have preferred to fight with her husband and son to the death. Instead, she was charged to lead the women and children of Bëor's folk who had to flee for their lives from their homes after the Dagor Bragollach for their land was now taken and ruled by Sauron, Morgoth's commander. Eventually, after many hardships on their journey, Emeldir was successful in bringing them safely to Brethil where the Haladin who were also the Edain dwelt. It was because of doing all this that she gained the title Man-hearted.[3]
Her only grandchild and grandson was the Half-elven Dior Eluchil who later became the King of Doriath, and her great-grandchildren were Eluréd with his twin-brother Elurín, and their younger sister Elwing.

 Etymology 
Emel means 'mother' in Sindarin.[4]

Dúnedain (House of Isildur)



Aratan was the second son of Isildur.

Contents[show]
 Biography 
Aratan did not take part in the invasion of Mordor or the Siege of Barad-dûr. Instead, his father sent he and his brother Ciryon to Minas Ithil with a force in case Sauron should break or escape the siege through Cirith Dúath, and assail the Dúnedain before he was yet defeated.[3] He like his brothers Elendur and Ciryon, were slain at the Gladden Fields.[4][2][5]

 Etymology 
Aratan translates from the High-Elven tongue (Quenya) into the Common Speech as ""Royal Man"". The second element in the name, atan, is the root of Atani, the ancient, Quenyan word referring to the whole race of Man.

 Portrayals in adaptations 
 In The Lord of the Rings Online the three elder sons of Isildur appear during an extended flashback set during the Siege of Barad-dûr in the year S.A. 3440. However, because the game's license does cover the works in which they are named, they are referred to only by their war-time aliases, meant to hide their kinship with the King. Aratan uses the name ""Ornaher"" as his alias.

Valandil, the other son, the King of Arnor after Isildur.

 Earlier versions of the legendarium 
The forerunning name for the character Aratan was Eärnur.[6]

Valaraukar (Balrogs of Morgoth)



Gothmog (Sindarin IPA: [ˈɡoθmoɡ] - ""Strife and Hate"") was the Lord of Balrogs during the First Age, and the greatest Balrog ever to walk Middle-earth. As the High Captain of Angband, his only equal in rank was Sauron. He fought many battles in the name of his master Morgoth, and was personally responsible for killing two of the High Kings of the Ñoldor.
Gothmog, like the rest of his kind, carried a fiery whip into battle, but was also known for wielding a great black axe, feared by elves across the continent of Beleriand.

 Biography 
    The death of Fëanor at the hands of Gothmog, by LuisFBejarano  
Gothmog was initially one of the Maiar who gave their allegiance to Melkor. Prior to the Revolt of the Ñoldor, he was the High Captain of Angband and given the title ""Lord of the Balrogs.""[3]
During the Dagor-nuin-Giliath in YT 1498,[4] Fëanor pressed to Angband with his company, and in that hour, the Balrogs were issued forth. Gothmog was among them. Fëanor came even within sight of Angband, but was ambushed with few elves about him. Soon he stood alone, but long he fought on alone with all balrogs. Gothmog turned in at the end of the bout, and at the last Gothmog, Lord of the Balrogs, smote him to the ground, inflicting a mortal wound, and the High King of the Ñoldor  plunged to the ground. The Sons of Fëanor arrived and carried the body of their father away, but Fëanor had passed.[3] Gothmog reappeared as a general of Angband in several more major conflicts, including the Dagor Aglareb and the Nirnaeth Arnoediad. During the Nirnaeth, Gothmog engaged the High King of the Ñoldor, Fingon, in battle. Gothmog separated Fingon from the main host but was unable to kill Fingon until another Balrog appeared behind the Ñoldor ""cast a throng of steel about him"". This allowed Gothmog to slay Fingon and beat the body to dust. Thereafter, he captured Húrin, father of Túrin Turambar, and dragged him back to Angband.[1]

    Ecthelion charges Gothmog as they fight to the death.  
In FA 510, Gothmog and the forces of Angband beseiged the Hidden City of Gondolin. They held the northern gates and were later confronted by Ecthelion of the Fountain, whom Gothmog dueled. Knocking Ecthelion's sword out of his hands, Gothmog prepared to strike at him, but, as he raised his axe, Ecthelion ran forward at the Balrog lord, ramming his pointed helmet into the beast's chest and forcing both of them into the Fountain of the King. The waters quenched the flames of Gothmog that kept him alive and drowned Ecthelion, ending the Battle of Gondolin.[5][6]

 Etymology 
The name Gothmog is from the Quenyan terms gos or goth (""dread"") and -mbaw (""compel, force, subject, oppress"").[7]
Gothmog's Quenya name was Osombauko (or Oþombauko; IPA: [osomˈbaʊko] or Vanyarin [oθomˈbaʊko]).[citation needed]","

Ñoldor, Gondolindrim (House of the Fountain)



Ecthelion, or Ecthelion of the Fountain, was a mighty lord of Gondolin during the First Age of Middle-earth, and one of its greatest heroes. 

Contents[show]
 Biography 
 Early life 
Most of Ecthelion's early life is unknown but he might have lived in Aman in Tirion and might have been one of the followers of Fingolfin. He passed through the dangerous Helcaraxë and lived. After he survived the grinding ice, he settled in Vinyamar in Nevrast before moving to Gondolin in FA 116. He later became lord of the House of the Fountain.

 Aredhel's Escort 
Two hundred years after Gondolin was wrought, Ecthelion, Glorfindel and Egalmoth, along with the White Lady of the Ñoldor left the Hidden City due to Aredhel's yearning for the freedom she once had in Valinor. Their orders were to lead her towards Hithlum, where she would meet her elder brother Fingon. When coming upon the Ford of Brithiach, Aredhel ordered them to turn south, for she desired to see the Sons of Fëanor. Thus, Ecthelion and his companions sought admittance to Doriath, but the wardens refused them entrance inside the Girdle of Melian. Having no other choice, they took the dangerous road between the haunted valleys of Ered Gorgoroth. Near Nan Dungortheb, the Valley of Dreadful Death, the riders were caught in a mesh of shadows and they were lost from Aredhel. In vain, they sought her afterwards, but the fell offspring of Ungoliant that dwelt in that place pursued them. Barely escaping alive, the three lords returned to Gondolin without the princess, where they were received in sorrow.[1]

 A Lord of Gondolin 
In the year, FA 473 Ecthelion fought alongside Turgon in the battle Nirnaeth Arnoediad, leading a wing of Gondolin's forces. Upon the defeat of the Ñoldor, he defended a flank as Turgon retreated.[2]
Twenty-three years after Nirnaeth Arnoediad, Tuor and Voronwë of Gondolin traveled towards the Hidden City. After being led by Elemmakil through the Seven Gates, Ecthelion appeared before them as Warden of the Great Gate.
And high and noble as was Elemmakil, greater and more lordly was Ecthelion, Lord of the Fountains, at that time Warden of the Great Gate. All in silver was he clad, and upon his shining helm there was set a spike of steel pointed with a diamond; and as his esquire took his shield it shimmered as if it were bedewed with drops of rain, that were indeed a thousand studs of crystal.—Unfinished Tales, Of Tuor and his Coming to Gondolin
Ecthelion initially denied passage for Tuor but when Tuor made a reference towards Ulmo, the Lord of the Waters, Ecthelion eventually allowed him entry.

    Ecthelion and Glorfindel, by Jenny Dolfen  
He was the leader of the House of the Fountain, one of the Twelve Houses of the Gondolindrim. His people were fond of diamonds and silver, and their array was beautiful to the sight. In FA 510 during the Fall of Gondolin, Ecthelion led his house into battle accompanied by the music of their flutes and great were the damages caused to the enemy by their long, bright swords.[3]

 Warcry of the Eldar 
In the battle over Gondolin, Ecthelion and his forces made their entrance from the South part of the city, after previously being held in reserve. So terrible was his voice when commanding the drawing of the swords and the killings, which followed, that his name became a terror among the enemy and a Warcry to the Eldar. Valiantly fighting side by side with Tuor and his House of the Wing, they drove away the orcs until almost the Gate was regained. As Dragons reinforced Morgoth's army, Ecthelion killed three Balrogs and his sword did ""hurt to their fire"". Outnumbered, they had to retreat. When doing so, Ecthelion's left arm was wounded and his shield fell to earth. Tuor carried him away as they joined the remaining leaders in the Square of the King.
In that place, the great Fountain of the King stood and Ecthelion regained his strength by drinking from it. As seven dragons lead the enemy's forces towards the Square, the remaining army of Gondolin began retreat. All but Ecthelion, who remained near the fountain in a stand, which was remembered as the most valiant ""in all the songs or in any tale"". It was there that he faced Gothmog, Lord of Balrogs.[3]

 Bane of Gothmog 
    Ecthelion preparing to face Gothmog during the Fall of Gondolin, by Cloister  
Tuor tried to stand in the way of Gothmog, but he was thrown aside. Then Ecthelion, fairest of the Ñoldor, but whose face now had the pallor of grey steel, dueled him. Losing his sword due to a wound received he was unable to protect himself. Just as Gothmog was about to deliver the finishing blow, Ecthelion jumped and wrapped his legs around the demon, driving the spike of his helmet into Gothmog's body. This caused Gothmog to lose his balance, and they both fell into the Fountain of the King, and drowned.
Later, a young Eärendil asked about him, saying that he wished Ecthelion were there, ""to play to me on his flute, or make me willow whistles! Perchance has he gone on ahead?"" After he was informed of Ecthelion's death, he ""wept bitterly"" and said that he cared no more to see the streets of Gondolin.[3]

 Etymology 
There are three different sources that offer a translation of Ecthelion, and they differ substantially.

 In The Book of Lost Tales Part Two Appendix, it is said that the name derives from the Quenya ehtelë (""issue of water, spring""), a reference to his title as Lord for the House of the Fountain.
 In the etymologies of The Lost Road and Other Writings, his name is composed from ehtë, (""spear"") and thela, (""point"") (of spear). Put together they would translate as ""Spear-point"" or ""Spear-head"".
 In The War of the Jewels, which seems to be the last matter J.R.R. Tolkien wrote on it, the name is derived from aeg, (""sharp"") and thel, (""intent, resolve""). This would translate ""one of sharp resolve"".

 Other versions of the legendarium 
    Ecthelion against Gothmog, by Jenny Dolfen at goldseven.de  
Perhaps the earliest full tale of J.R.R. Tolkien's, The Fall of Gondolin, was written during a leave of absence from the World War I, in the year 1916. It is in that story, published posthumously by Christopher Tolkien in the volume The Book of Lost Tales Part Two that Ecthelion first appears. Thus, he is one of the first characters Tolkien ever created.
However, from a chronological point of view, the first account of his presence is the chapter Of Maeglin from The Silmarillion. The events described here took place more than one hundred and fifty years before those of Gondolin's fall. Along with Glorfindel of Gondolin and Egalmoth, he was assigned by Turgon as Aredhel's escort on her ill-fated journey. Though no name is mentioned, only that ""Turgon appointed three lords of his household"", an explanatory note in the volume The War of the Jewels, chapter called Maeglin, sheds light on the escorts' identities.[4]

Men of Gondor (House of Baranor)



Bergil was the older son of Beregond of Gondor. A boy of ten at the time of the War of the Ring, he accompanied Peregrin Took when he first arrived in the city of Minas Tirith. Bergil had an uncle named Iorlas, who was the same age as Pippin. It is not certain whether Iorlas was the brother of Beregond or of Bergil's mother, although Iorlas does not follow the alliterative pattern evident in males known to be related to Beregond (Bergil, Borlas).

Contents[show]
 Biography 
Born in TA 3009, Bergil was nine years old at the time when the War of the Ring began. He was one of the few children that remained in Minas Tirith during that when the forces of Mordor were preparing to lay siege on the city. He guided Peregrin Took throughout the city when he and Gandalf arrived, and they became very good friends in the process. Before the armies of Mordor were about to lay siege, Bergil and Pippin witnessed the arrival of several armies from other parts of Gondor to defend the city. During the siege of Minas Tirith, Bergil helped the healers of the city as an errand runner and so eventually contributed to the healing of Faramir, the Steward's son and later Prince of Ithilien.
Bergil who, running errands for the healers of Minas Tirith, told Gandalf where Pippin and the injured Meriadoc Brandybuck were; Merry, suffering from the Black Breath, had gotten lost during the battle over the fields of Pelennor. He was also the one who brought the Athelas leaves to Aragorn; at that time, he showed his love for Faramir by bursting into tears. Bergil also kept Merry company while the Captains of the West led their men off to the Black Gate and then escorted him back to the Houses of Healing.[1]
Of Bergil's destiny the novel or its appendices tell nothing. It is probable that he went with his father into Ithilien after the War of the Ring was over. His younger brother Borlas was central to ""The New Shadow"", the soon-abandoned draft for a The Lord of the Rings.[2]

 Personality 
Bergil is one of the few children in The Lord of the Rings who is affected by the course of war. By refusing to leave the endangered city, he becomes an ""unlikely hero"", courageously serving his master and country in ways unanticipated by his father, Beregond. His friendship and loyalty to Peregrin Took contributed greatly to establishing the latter's affinity to Gondor.

 Etymology 
Bergil means ""Valiant star"" from ber (""valiant"") and gil (""star"").[citation needed]","

""Save it from capture by all means that you can find, and at all costs; even at the cost of being held a coward who deserted me. Take your companion with you and flee! Go! I command you!""
Thus it was Ohtar and his companion that delivered the shards of Narsil to Rivendell after Isildur was killed, and there they were kept in safety, when at last during the War of the Ring they were reforged by Aragorn II Elessar into Andúril, the Flame of the West, and taken again to the war against Sauron.[2][3]

Orophin as he appears in the films

Orophin

Physical description

Race
Elves


Culture
Silvan Elves, Galadhrim



Orophin was a Silvan Marchwarden from Lothlórien, and the brother of Haldir and Rúmil.

Contents[show]
 Biography 
    Orophin, with his brothers Haldir and Rumil  
Orophin guarded the border of the country to the west, at the time of the War of the Ring. He stood guard along with other elves, including his brothers Haldir and Rumil.[1]
Like Rúmil, Orophin knew very little Westron (the Common Tongue) and so associated very little with the Fellowship. When Haldir saw Gollum rustling through the trees near where the hobbits stayed for the night, Orophin left his brothers to warn the Galadhrim.[1]

 Etymology 
The name Orophin might either be Sindarin or Silvan Elvish.[2] It may mean ""Small tree"", from the Sindarin oron (""tree"") and pîn (""small""),[3] or ""Mountain Peak"", from orod (""mountain"") and pind (""peak, crest"").[4]

 Other versions of the legendarium 
In Tolkien's drafts, Orophin's name was spelled as Orfin and Orofin.[5] When Haldir first met the Fellowship, Orofin was not present to accompany his brother.[6]

 Portrayal in adaptations 
    Orophin in The Lord of the Rings Online  
 Jason Secto portrays Orophin in the 2001 film, The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring.[7]

 Orophin is featured in The Lord of the Rings Trading Card Game.

 In The Lord of the Rings Online Orophin can be found on the western outskirts of Lothlorien, defending the borders against the orc attacks.

Ñoldor, Elves of Nargothrond



Gwindor was an Elf of Nargothrond in the First Age. He was the son of Guilin and a Prince of Nargothrond.

Contents[show]
 Biography 
Gwindor was credited with beginning the Nirnaeth Arnoediad when, at the sight of his brother Gelmir's brutal murder at the hands of orcs, he charged the hosts of Morgoth on the plains of Anfauglith by his own will. He was ultimately captured when Morgoth's reserves were set forth from the fortress and the armies of Men and Elves were overrun. He was enslaved and became a thrall of Angband for seventeen years (FA 472 -489).
Gwindor later escaped Angband, but his hand was cut off in a fight with a guard. The injury devastated Gwindor and he fell into despair in the wilderness, and nearly died of the wound. He was rescued by Beleg Strongbow and his will to live returned. He later helped Beleg free Túrin Turambar and, after Beleg's tragic and accidental death, Gwindor found himself trying to rouse Túrin as Beleg had roused him. He brought Túrin to Nargothrond, and in time would counsel against Túrin's policy of open warfare against Morgoth, but was ignored. He loved the elf Finduilas, but found himself unfit to wed her, and an engagement between them was broken. He grew jealous of Túrin since she loved him more and felt Túrin had gained respect from the council at his expense. He warned Finduilas that Túrin was cursed and would bring doom to the people he loved. Nevertheless, Gwindor pitied and loved him. He was mortally wounded in the Battle of Tumhalad, the last battle of Nargothrond. Túrin abandoned the battle and bore him to safety, but his wounds could not be healed. Gwindor died reproaching Túrin for his pride and pleading him to save Finduilas, who alone stood between Túrin and his doom.[2][3][4]

 Etymology 
Gwindor consists of the Noldorin word gwind (""pale blue""), or in Quenya, vinya (""young""). Dor has several meanings (""high, lofty, noble, king, or master"").[5]

 Earlier versions of the legendarium 
In The Book of Lost Tales Part Two, Flinding is the initial name for Gwindor, and he appears when Turin kills Beleg by accident.[6]

Culture
Númenoreans (House of Elros)



Soronto was a Númenorean nobleman of the royal lineage of Númenor or the House of Elros, the grandson of Tar-Meneldur and son of Ailinel, a sister of Tar-Aldarion.[1] He lived during the later years of the first millennium of the Second Age. His father was Orchaldor, a descendant of the House of Hador.

Contents[show]
 Biography 
Before the change in Númenor's law that turned the order of succession into cognatic primogeniture, Soronto may have been heir presumptive to the throne.[2] Tolkien intended to write a story about Tar-Aldarion's daughter Tar-Ancalimë and her cousin Soronto, and how she married only to take away Soronto's chances at the throne.

 Etymology 
Soronto's name apparently means ""Eagle"", ""Eagle-friend"" or perhaps ""Man of the Eagle"" in Quenya from soron (""eagle"").[3]

Dallas Barnett (TCG)



Bill Ferny was a Man of Bree and a known agent of Saruman before and during the War of the Ring.

Contents[show]
 Biography 
Bill Ferny resided in Bree and was known as an sneering, nefarious character who would sell anything to anyone, including dealings with shady travelers from the South, the agents of Saruman and Sauron.[1] Ferny lived near the South-gate of Bree.[1]
In Bree, Merry saw Ferny selling information about the hobbits to the Nazgûl. Ferny may have also let loose the ponies that otherwise could have been used by the hobbits to leave the city. As a further bit of profit (and ignoring any loyalty to Saruman or the Black Riders), he sold a pony named Bill to Strider and the hobbits, for which he demanded twelve silver pennies, over three times its value.[1]
Later, he supported Saruman's mechanization of the Shire, becoming a watchman at the Brandywine Bridge. Bill (the pony) repaid his former master for his mistreatment by kicking him. Ferny's ultimate fate is unknown, but as far as the folk of the Shire knew he was never heard from again.[2]

 Portrayal in adaptations 
    Bill Ferny in The Lord of the Rings Online  
Ferny is also featured in The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring (video game), in which he is killed confronting Strider in the streets.
Bill Ferny was featured as a character in The Lord of the Rings Trading Card Game as a card called Bill Ferny, Swarthy Sneering Fellow.[3]
Ferny appears in The Lord of the Rings Online video game, spreading mischief in and around Bree. Early on, he is revealed to be in league with a band of brigands in the service of ""Sharkey"" (Saruman) that operate all over Bree-land. It is shown that he is intent in supporting an alliance between the brigands and some Orcs of the Misty Mountains, undoubtedly serving himself the most. He believes that such  arrangement would allow him to pillage and plunder easier, hence his interest in it. Much to his chagrin, however, the alliance isn't forged. 
In The Hobbit: The Desolation of Smaug, Ferny's father appeared as an assassin hired by Azog along with his partner Squint to hunt down Thorin II Oakenshield.

Damrod was a Ranger of Ithilien, one of the most trusted of Faramir's men, and companion of Mablung.

Contents[show]
 Biography 
Damrod led the night patrol that captured Gollum in the Forbidden Pool. He also fought in the battle for Osgiliath. Damrod retreated to Minas Tirith with all the surviving defenders. A few days later, Damrod was sent with Faramir and his 100 men to reclaim Osgiliath from the enemy. Damrod was among the dead; it is said his body was never recovered due to the overwhelming Orc invasion of Gondor. Damrod had little hope, for he believed ""the days of Gondor are numbered, and the walls of Minas Tirith are doomed.""[1]

 Portrayal in adaptations 
Damrod is featured in The Lord of the Rings Trading Card Game as a card entitled Damrod, Dunadan of Gondor.[2]

Portrayal in adaptations
    Damrod in The Lord of the Rings Online  
In The Lord of the Rings Online Mablung and Damrod are first met in Osgiliath culverts, hiding from the enemy forces above. Having been separated from Faramir, they are unaware of his fate and send the player looking for sings of him throughout the overrun city. While some of those hiding eventually make a break for Minas Tirith (the player among them), Mablung and Damrod stay behind along with some other Rangers and spend the siege of the White City hiding under the enemy's feet. After the the Battle of the Pelennor Fields they are finally able to come out and join the Host of the West on the march towards the Black Gate. Upon entering the Wastes of Morannon, Damrod is chosen to lead the faint-hearted soldiers relieved by Aragorn and now commanded by Lord Duinhir towards Cair Andros through Ithilien wilderness. After King Elessar charges Steward Faramir with cleansing the evil of Minas Morgul and the Morgul Vale, Damrod joins other Rangers in a camp outside the dead city. He later leads a group of Rangers inside Minas Morgul itself, using the confusion among enemy forces to sneak between the guard towers beneath the enemy's notice.

","Sandyman also known as Sandyman the Miller or The Miller was a Hobbit of the Shire. 

Contents[show]
 History 
Sandyman was born sometime in the late Third Age. He became the owner of the Old Mill in Hobbiton sometime before TA 3001 (SR 1401). He was the father to Ted Sandyman. His fist name was never told in the story. He was always ready to pass on tall tales, he was an opinionated fellow, who was not well liked by Samwise Gamgee's father Hamfast Gamgee. He was present in the Ivy Bush drinking at table with The Gaffer and discussions happenings and rumors in the Shire, just before Bilbo's Farewell Birthday Party. It seems that he died sometime in the years before the War of the Ring, with his Mill being inherited by Ted, who sold it to Lotho Sackville-Baggins during his takeover of the Shire.

 Portrayal in Adaptations 
 Video Games 
In The Hobbit (2003 video game), Sandyman was given the full name of ""Carl Sandyman"" and was the son of the miller in the game. He held his father's hammer and nails which Bilbo had to get before the bridge over The Water could be repaired.

Thuringwethil was Sauron's herald and was stationed at Tol-in-Gaurhoth by the time of the Quest for the Silmaril. She was probably slain or died during the fight between Sauron and Huan in the fortress.
She served as a herald, or a messenger, for Sauron at Tol-Sirion. Her origins were not mentioned, but her ability to take forms suggest that she could be a Maia. She was described to have fingered-wings and iron claws. Lúthien was disguised as Thuringwethil and introduced herself as such upon infiltrating Angband.[1]


'Thuringwethil I am, who cast
a shadow o'er the face aghast
of the sallow moon in the doomed land
of shivering Beleriand.'


― Lúthien in her disguise, Lay of Leithian, Canto XIII[2]

 Etymology 
Thuringwethil means ""Woman of the Secret Shadow""[3] from the Sindarin thurin (""secret"") and gwath (""shadow"").[4]

","Tobold Hornblower, also called Old Toby, was a Hobbit of the Shire.

Contents[show]
Biography
Tobold was a well-respected gardener, most notable for his discovery and cultivation of the herb Pipe-weed c. TA 2670, or 1070 by Shire Reckoning. He resided in the Southfarthing village of Longbottom, and was there immortalized as 'Old Toby'. His Pipe-weed business led to the herb's popularity throughout the Shire and beyond.[1][2]
The Pipe-weed variety 'Old Toby' was named after him, and 'Longbottom Leaf' possibly refers to him as well. According to Herblore of the Shire, by Meriadoc Brandybuck, it was believed that Tobold Hornblower learned about Pipe-weed in Bree, as that was the farthest from the Shire that he traveled and the herb grows on the south slopes of the hill there. His date of death is not recorded, but he likely died sometime in the twenty-seventh century of the Third Age.[3]

""There's knife-work here needs doing! Come on, you sea rats, get off your ships!""
—Guritz to the Corsairs

Guritz[1] was an Orc captain in Peter Jackson's The Return of the King film who served Gothmog at the Battle of the Pelennor Fields.
He does not appear in J.R.R. Tolkien's books.

Contents[show]
 Portrayal in adaptations

Guritz had a large scar across his face that split his nose in two. He wore a helmet with a skull impaled on a spike, earning him the nickname Skully from the movie production crew, and the only weapon he was seen wielding was a two-handed scythe. He fled the charging Rohirrim and went with Murgash and a band of Orcs to the docks to mock the late-arriving Corsairs aboard their ships. But the Corsairs were not on board; instead, Guritz and his company were met by Aragorn, Legolas, and Gimli, and the first wave of the Army of the Dead. When the Army of the Dead charged, Guritz tried to escape but fell backwards and was trampled by the charging army.

 Video games 
He is also seen in The Lord of the Rings: Conquest video game as a warrior type Orc captain whom you must kill in many missions in the War of the Ring campaign.

Contents[show]
 Biography 
Elendur was the son of Valandur, who succeeded his father as King of Arnor for one hundred and twenty-five years. He was perhaps named for Isildur's eldest son, who also bore the name Elendur. He died in TA 777 and his son Eärendur, who would be the last of Arnor's Kings, succeeded him.
Events from his reign are not precisely known, but it was probably a peaceful one.[2]

 Etymology 
Elendur is a Quenyan word.[3]

Eärendur was the tenth and last King of a united Arnor.

Contents[show]
 Biography 
Eärendur ascended the throne of Arnor in TA 777 after the death of his father Elendur. During his reign, the realm of Arnor became divided and there was rivalry amongst Eärendur's three sons all of which claimed the throne. To prevent civil war, the Kingdom of Arnor was split in the three parts Arthedain, Cardolan, and Rhudaur. He died in TA 861 after ruling for eighty-four years. His oldest son Amlaith became the first King of Arthedain.
Afterwards, the Kingdom of Arnor remained divided and at war with each other. In time, the lines of the Kingdoms of both Cardolan and Rhudaur failed and soon became vassals of Angmar and were soon destroyed. The Kings of Arthedain remained until the fall of Fornost and the death of Arvedui over eleven hundred years later. From then after, there was no King of Arnor and its lineage would be preserved through the Heirs of Isildur that rested solely in Chieftains of the Dúnedain, until Aragorn II Elessar became King of Arnor in TA 3019.[2]

Etymology
Eärendur is a Quenya word meaning 'Sea-servant' or 'Servant of the Sea'.[3]

Nandor (Elves of Doriath)



Saeros was an Elf of the Nandor of Doriath, and one of King Thingol's high councilors.

 Biography 
Saeros had no love for Túrin Turambar, a foreigner to Doriath, and disliked his close association with the king, being either jealous or generally unfriendly with all mankind. He spoke ill of Túrin and his people at a meeting, provoking Túrin to be angry and injure Saeros. Later, he tried to waylay Túrin in the woods but Túrin overcame him and sent him to run naked in the wild. Attempting to leap across a small fjord, he lost footing and was killed by impact upon a great rock below. This incident caused Túrin to be exiled from Doriath.[2][3]
Saeros had been a friend of the minstrel Daeron.

 Other versions of the legendarium 
In earlier versions of The Silmarillion Saeros was called Orgol, before which Orgof, and was a kinsman to King Thingol. Instead of confronting Túrin in the woods, he taunted him and was killed during a dinner party by a goblet that was thrown at him by Túrin. As Orgol, he was one of the Nandor who dwelt in Amon Ereb before the fall of their Lord Denethor.[1]

 Biography 
Gimilkhâd was considered to be a harsh man. He followed the ways of his father and opposed his brother Inziladûn who changed his name to Tar-Palantir when he became king, intending to repent the ways of his father and follow the ways of the Faithful. Therefore, Gimilkhâd became the leader of the King's Men in Númenór and preserved their ways in secret during the reign of Tar-Palantir. His son, obedient to his father's ways he usurped Tar-Palantir's daughter Míriel who by right deserved to rule as Ruling Queen, and ruled Númenór as king.[2][1]

Númenóreans (House of Elros)



Gimilzagar was a Númenórean of the royal house of Elros.

 Biography 
Gimilzagar was the younger son of King Tar-Calmacil, the eighteenth ruler of the island kingdom. His line of descent made him the great-uncle of Tar-Calmacil's grandson Ar-Adûnakhôr, who broke with tradition by taking his royal name in the Adûnaic tongue.
He may have been a ancestor of Inzilbeth, mother of Tar-Palantir.[1]

Andróg (IPA: [ˈandrɔːg]) was a Adan of the First Age in the band of outlaws that included Turin Turambar.[1] He was the father of Andvír.

 Biography 
Andróg was descended from the Folk of Hador and originally lived in the land of Dor-lómin, but having slain a woman; he was hunted and fled southward. Being an archer, he then joined Gaurwaith, a band of outlaws that hunted the forests to the south of river Taeglin, and was remembered as ""the grimmest among them"".
When Túrin first appeared among the outlaws and slew one of their men, Andróg quickly perceived both Túrin's superiority and the Curse of Morgoth that followed him, but still esteemed him and became one of his closest followers. Later Túrin spared Andróg despite his participating in Forweg's attempt to trap Larnach's daughter, and Andróg supported him in becoming the leader of the band. After Beleg was captured by the outlaws, Andróg egged them to kill him, coveting Beleg's bow Belthronding, and he showed no favour to the Elf even after his release by Túrin.
Andróg was the foremost in the attempt to capture the Petty-dwarves, seizing Mîm and shooting arrows at his sons. Once again, he wished to slay Mîm immediately, despising all dwarves, and misdoubted his gift of Amon Rûdh. Andróg was cursed by Mîm when it became known that his arrow slew Khîm:


""He that loosed the shaft shall break his bow and his arrows and lay them at my son's feet; and he shall never take arrow nor bear bow again. If he does, he shall die by it.""
—Mîm

Andróg obeyed, fearing the Dwarf's curse, but prophecised in reply that Mîm will ""lack a bow at need ere his end"".[2] Some time afterwards Andróg took up bow and arrows again, and was wounded by a poisoned shaft. He was healed by Beleg at Túrin's bidding, but continued to mistrust the Elf; Mîm's curse, however, was not put to rest thus. In fact this act made Mîm even more angry, because all Petty-dwarves hate Elves with a passion.
During the Sack of Amon Rûdh Andróg lead some of the band to the top of the hill by a secret stair that he discovered some time before. There he fought more valiantly than any, but fell mortally wounded by an arrow. His son Andvír, however, survived the battle.[3]

 References 
↑ Hurin

↑ In Unfinished Tales another version of this latter curse is given as primary, that Mîm will ""die with a dart in his throat"". However, J. R. R. Tolkien's intentions concerning this are unknown, as elsewhere Mîm is stated to have been slain by Húrin with a sword, and this is the story included by Christopher Tolkien into the published Silmarillion. See ""Narn i Hîn Húrin"": ""Of Mîm the Dwarf"" and note 18

↑ Ælfwine and Dírhaval, pg. 311 (see note 1): ""... he found a man named Andvír, and he was very old, but was the son of that Andróg who was in the outlaw-band of Túrin, and alone survived the battle on the summit of Amon Rûdh."" The wording of J. R. R. Tolkien is unclear, and on p. 315 Christopher Tolkien surmised that it was Andróg who survived the battle. But this cannot have been intended by his father, as this would discard the history of Andróg's death stated elsewhere (Unfinished Tales) and also there would have been no need to introduce Andvír as the source.

Edain (House of Hador)



Sador was an Edain Man and the trusted servant of Húrin, and a childhood friend of Túrin.

Contents[show]
 Biography 
Sador was in his youth a woodsman, and he learned how to carve and craft things out of wood. In FA 455 the Dagor Bragollach broke out, and Fingolfin, High King of the Ñoldor, summoned him to the war against Morgoth. Sador arrived at the battle too late, but came soon enough to carry the bier of Hador, his lord. He decided afterward to become a soldier. In FA 462, he defended Barad Eithel, and soon after stopped being a soldier. He began woodworking again, but misfortune was his lot, for he accidentally cut off his right foot with an axe.
Sador found service with Húrin, and was a woodcrafter for him. He met Túrin, and was given the name Labadal, which translates to 'hopafoot' in the Sindarin tongue. This name was not given in scorn, but pity. Túrin also gave Sador the elven knife that he received for his birthday. Sador would craft carvings of men, beasts, and other things, and teach Túrin morals.
Morwen, Húrin's wife, was not fond of Sador. She said that he did not work fast, and spent too much time ""on trifles unbidden"". However, Húrin was moved by Túrin's pity for Sador, and gave him the task of carving a chair for his hall.
Before the Nirnaeth Arnoediad, Húrin left to go to war. Sador began serving Morwen. Sador did not fight in the Battle of Unnumbered Tears, and was dismayed that he could not do so, and ""die a valiant death."" When Túrin left to go to Doriath he first talked to Sador. Sador talked with him about the necessity of his departure. Túrin was sad, but understood. Sador urged him to take back the elven knife. Túrin refused, saying that he would get many things like it in Doriath.
Sador stayed in the house of Morwen for a long while but after the loss of the Nirnaeth Arnoediad, he was enslaved by the Easterlings just like the rest of the Men of Dor-lómin.[2][3] After thirty years, Túrin returned from Doriath and Nargothrond, now a very tall man. Sador (who was now old) met Túrin at Aerin's house, and participated in a rebellion against the Easterlings (led by Brodda) that had taken over the area. During the uprising, Sador was fatally wounded by the enemy. He was, however, able to say his final words to Túrin before perishing.[4][5]

Etymology
Sador is a Sindarin word meaning ""steadfast, trusty, or loyal"".[6]

Aerin was an Edain woman of Dor-lómin.

Biography
Aerin was the daughter of Indor who was closely related to Húrin Thalion of House of Hador. When the treacherous Easterlings invaded Hithlum as payment for fighting on Morgoth's side in the Nirnaeth Arnoediad, Aerin was cruelly seized by Brodda and taken to wife against her will hoping to produce an heir to legitimize his rule as Lord of Hithlum.[1] She secretly helped Húrin's wife Morwen. She sheltered Sador, the former servant of Húrin and childhood friend of Túrin. When Túrin, son of Húrin, returned to Dor-lómin, he learned from Aerin that his mother had left Hithlum. He became angry and in his rage he killed Brodda. While being hunted to the death, one of Túrin's followers saw the Hall of Brodda on fire and guessed that she had set it, and she burned to death in the fire. Afterwards, the remainder of the House of Hador in Dor-lómin were now at risk of being persecuted even more cruelly then they ever were before.[2]

Marhwini was the first lord of the people who became known as the Éothéod, later the Rohirrim.

Contents[show]
Biography
Marhwini was the son of Marhari, who led a remnant of the Northmen to battle alongside Gondor to stop the advance of the Wainriders years earlier. Through Marhari his father, he was also a direct descendant of Vidugavia, 'King of Rhovanion'.
Marhwini's father Marhari first aligned his people with Gondor in a fight with the Wainriders called the Battle of the Plains. In that conflict, King Narmacil II of Gondor was slain, as was Marhari. Marhwini then led a remnant of what remained of the Northmen to the vales of Anduin, where they mixed with fugitives escaped from the east. This was the beginning of the culture that would become the Rohirrim.
During the reign of Calimehtar, King of Gondor, Marhwini sent word to Gondor that a host of Wainriders was preparing to assault the land of Calenardhon (later Rohan). Eager to avenge Gondor's prior defeat by the Wainriders, Calimehtar led an army out of Gondor and joined with Northmen under Marhwini. The combined force overwhelmed the Wainriders' army. As Marhwini had hoped, many thralls of the Wainriders who had once been among the Northmen revolted, and caused their captor's settlements to be destroyed. As the Wainriders retreated from battle, they were forced to return far to the east, having been defeated and driven from their homes. Thus were the Men of Éothéod for a time victorious.
He had a son named Forthwini.[1]

Etymology
Marhwini means horse-friend, and is taken from the Gothic language with Marh (mearh in Old English) meaning 'horse' and wini (winë in Old English) meaning 'friend'.[1]    Marhwini in The Lord of the Rings Online  
Portrayals in adaptations
In The Lord of the Rings Online Marhwini appears in a flashback narrating the history of the Eotheod. His son is named Forthwini and grandson Forthári, both of whom die in battle to the orcs, leaving Forthári's son Frumgar as Marhwini's only heir.

Daeron (also spelled ""Dairon"") was a Sindarin elf of Doriath and King Thingol's loremaster and minstrel. Because of his love for Lúthien, he was jealous of Beren One-hand, and was a key figure in the betrayal of their love to Thingol.[1]
Daeron was a brilliant loremaster, and the greatest musician in Middle-earth. Second to him was Maglor, one of Feanor's sons.[1]

Contents[show]
 Biography 
Daeron was born in Middle-earth at some undetermined time. Following the folk of Elwë, he became an important elf close to King Thingol, serving as his loremaster and minstrel. He devised the Cirth (familiarly known as Runes), which would later become an important writing form.[2]
Daeron and Mablung both attended the Mereth Aderthad to bear greetings from their King.[3]
He loved Thingol's daughter, Lúthien, more than anything, devising music in her honor and often played it while she danced. However, she did not return his affections. Twenty years after the Return of the Ñoldor, he attended the Mereth Aderthad with his kinsman Mablung bearing gifts and greetings to the Ñoldor from the King of Doriath. Hundreds of years later when Beren came to Doriath, Lúthien and Beren fell in love, though they kept it secret from Thingol, knowing he would not approve of his daughter promising herself to a mortal. However, Daeron's jealousy of their love for each other caused him to spy on them both and report what he saw and heard to Thingol.[1]

    Daeron's sorrow, by Filat  
Later, when Lúthien learned that Sauron had imprisoned Beren, she sought Daeron's counsel but he betrayed her to the king, causing her to be imprisoned in Hírilorn. After she had escaped and went away to find Beren and was feared to be lost, Daeron repented his previous deeds and left Doriath to search for her in vain. He lost his way somewhere in the far east of Middle-earth, where he dwelt in dark places lamenting his love for Lúthien. His fate or whereabouts afterwards in the world are not known.[1]

 Legacy 
His invention of the Cirth provided an alphabet of runes that the Dwarves adopted in their writings and spread throughout Middle-earth, passing them down from age to age. These runes would later become the script used in Moria and were known as Daeron's Runes.

 Etymology 
His name is derived from the Sindarin word daer (""large, great"").
In earlier etymologies of the legendarium the Doriathrin name is given as Dairon, of which the root was the Doriathrin word for shadow, dai. Consequently, Christopher Tolkien speculated in The Silmarillion that the name perhaps included the Sindarin word dae ""shadow"".

Bladorthin

Biographical information

Titles
King of an unspecified location


Death
Before TA 2941



Physical description

Race
Unknown



Bladorthin was king of an unknown location in the northeast of Middle-earth sometime in the late Third Age.
 Biography 
His realm was probably close in proximity to the Lonely Mountain, for in the last days of the Quest of Erebor, Thorin and Balin were said to wonder if Bladorthin's order was still intact:
""The spears made for the armies of the great King Bladorthin (long since dead), each had a thrice-forged head and their shafts were inlaid with cunning gold, but they were never delivered or paid for.""[1]
Therefore Bladorthin may have ruled either Lake-town, Dale, Rhûn, Dorwinion, or another location. The coming of Smaug or Bladorthin's own death may have been the reason for the spears' delayed delivery. 

 Etymology 
The name's origin is untold, but it possibly combines the Sindarin words blador, meaning ""wide plain"", and thin, meaning ""grey"". 

 Earlier versions of the legendarium 
In the first draft of The Hobbit, the name Bladorthin was given to Gandalf's character. In the final copy, however, the name only survives in this way.[1]

Culture
Sindar-elves ?. Elves of Doriath



Nellas was an Elf Maiden of Doriath during the First Age.

Contents[show]
 Biography 
Being a lady of nature, she lived in the woods and never came to the city but she knew much of things and was very wise. Nellas was young during the latter-half of the fourth century First Age and it was during that time that Túrin had come to Doriath as a boy. With the blessings of Melian, she befriended him and became his teacher and he learned much about the wilderness and nature. She also taught him an older and richer form of Sindarin and the many manners of its pronunciation. As he began to grow into manhood, he drifted away from her but she still continued to watch over him be it in secrecy.
Sitting in a tree watching over him, she witnessed the incident between Túrin and Saeros and saw that Saeros had indeed provoked Túrin and was the cause of his own peril. Summoned to appear before the King in one of the few times she walked in the city, she told him about what happen in the woods with great difficulty. After the King pronounced his judgment, she wept over Túrin’s departure and sought to find him but presumably she never saw him again. Her fate is unknown in the latter days of the First Age.[1][2][3]

 Etymology 
Although there appears to be no clear origin of the name Nellas, it is likely to have been Sindarin and may have come from the Sindarin words nellad, nella or nelladel, which all mean ""the sound of bells"" (or ""to sound the bells""), or perhaps the word nell, meaning ""bell"".

    Turin's childhood with Nellas by noei1984  
The element nel- may also connect with Elvish words for the number ""three"", and the final -las could mean ""leaf"" (as in the name Legolas, Greenleaf), though it is not apparent why a child should be called by a name meaning something like ""three leaves"".

Dírhael was the grandfather of Aragorn II Elessar and father of Gilraen.

Contents[show]
Biography
Dírhael was a stern man who found it hard to show his emotions. When Dírhael and Ivorwen lived in the north before Gilraen was born, he and Arador had been close friends and he watched over Arathorn's early years. As a protective father he was resistant to the relationship that started to grow between his daughter and Arathorn. His foresight also told him there was trouble ahead.
He was a descendant of Aranarth, the first Chieftain of the Dúnedain and the husband of Ivorwen. Their daughter Gilraen married Arathorn II, Aragorn's father.[1][2]

Behind the Scenes
In ""The Making of Appendix A"" in The Peoples of Middle-earth, Christopher Tolkien describes how his name had once been Dirhoel instead of Dírhael.[3]

 Fan Work 
Dírhael appeared in the fan-made film, Born of Hope and was played by an actor named Andrew McDonald.

Borlas was a Man of Gondor in the Fourth Age, and a key figure in J.R.R. Tolkien's short-lived story The New Shadow. He had two children, an unnamed daughter and a son Berelach, a friend of Saelon.[1]
Contents[show]
 Biography 
Borlas was the son of Beregond, the captain who saved Faramir from being burned by Denethor. After the War of the Ring, he lived in Pen-arduin, which was in Emyn Arnen.[2] Sometime in the past he caught a young man stealing an apple from his garden. He scolded him describing his behavior as ""Orc work"" but took the boy under his wing becoming his master. Years later, he learned through him of the growing shadow among Men and the possibility of a secret cult worshiping the old enemies of the world.[1]

 Etymology 
Borlas is Sindarin for ""Enduring joy"" from bor (""endure"") and glass or galas (""joy"").[3]

Eldalótë was the wife of Angrod, the second son of Finarfin. She was also grandmother of Gil-galad and Finduilas.

Contents[show]
Biography
Eldalótë was a Noldorin Elf likely to have been born in Valinor. It was in Valinor that she married Angrod and had one son named Orodreth. Orodreth later escaped to Nargothrond when his father was slain in the Dagor Bragollach.
She probably went into Exile and translated her name to Sindarin in Middle-earth (the Noldor who did not reach it had no Sindarin names, cf. Elenwe). Nothing else is known of her fate.[1]

Etymology
Eldalótë was a Quenya word that meant 'Elf Flower'. Edhellos (also spelled Eðellos) is the Sindarin translation of her name.

Dorlas was a Edain Man of the House of Haleth from Brethil who went with Túrin and Hunthor to slay the dragon Glaurung, but he ran in fear from the beast and was later killed by Brandir. He was the father of Avranc, a later enemy of Túrin's father.

 Biography 
When Túrin Turambar gathered the men of Brethil together in Ephel Brandir, calling for warriors to accompany him in his attack on Glaurung, Dorlas was the first to join. With no other volunteers forthcoming, Dorlas taunted Brandir, asking in a mocking tone who would take the latter's place in the party so that the House of Haleth would not be put to shame. Offering himself in the stead of his kinsman Brandir, Hunthor rebuked Dorlas and warned him against speaking evil of the leader of their people.
In hot pursuit of Glaurung, Dorlas and his two comrades came to Cabed-en-Aras and descended the perilous cliff while the river waters of the Taeglin roared below. However, when it came time to pass through the wild, rock-filled water, Dorlas quailed in fear and remained behind while Hunthor and Turin crossed to the opposite shore.
Hiding in shame in the nearby woods, Dorlas was eventually found by Brandir, who quickly perceived that Dorlas had abandoned his companions and their mission in fear. Blaming Dorlas for Níniel's suicide, Brandir slew Dorlas just as he was about to punch Brandir.[1]

Asgon was a man of Dor-lómin, and later an outlaw of the Ered Wethrin.
 Biography 
In the year FA 496, when Túrin Turambar came to Dor-lómin seeking news of his mother Morwen and sister Niënor, Túrin found the region under the control of Brodda the Easterling, who had taken Túrin's kinswoman Aerin as wife. Túrin killed Brodda in anger, instigating an uprising against the region's Easterling rulers. Learning his mother and sister no longer were present in Dor-lómin, Túrin departed, accompanied by Asgon and several others who had taken part in the uprising. Túrin left those who followed him in the mountains, but not before Asgon reminded Túrin of the hardship he had brought upon them, and warned him not to return unless it was to free them.[1]
After Túrin's death, Morgoth released Túrin's father Húrin from captivity in the year FA 500. Húrin traveled to Hithlum, where he met a small band of men led by Asgon, who gave Húrin an account of what Túrin had done in Dor-lómin. Asgon and his men would follow Húrin to confront the Easterling chief Lorgan, though little would come from that meeting. Húrin would leave his followers soon afterwards while they slept, travelling into Dimbar. In Húrin's absence, Asgon led the others into Brethil, where they were captured, but eventually released by the Haladin. Asgon, believing Húrin would one day return to Brethil, set a watch on the forest.[2]
Asgon's fate afterwards is unknown.

","Andvír was named as the son of Andróg, and was with his father one of Túrin's outlaws during the First Age.

 Biography 
Andvír was one of only three to escape from Amon Rûdh, along with Túrin and Beleg, after the massacre of Túrin's band following the petty-dwarf Mîm's betrayal.
Many years later, as an old man, Andvír was present at the Havens of Sirion when the poet Dírhavel arrived. Andvír supplied the poet with the account of Túrin's deeds from the time he fled Doriath to his coming to Nargothrond, and as a result saved that knowledge from being lost.[1]

 Behind the scenes 
Andvír is not mentioned in either the The Silmarillion or Unfinished Tales, and is referenced only in an introductory note to The Children of Húrin, and in Part Three of The War of the Jewels.

Enerdhil was a possibly mythical jewel-smith of Gondolin.

Contents[show]
 Biography 
Enerdhil is described as a lover of all things that grew green in the world and ever desired to see the sunlight through the leaves of the trees, and so he created a great green gem which was beloved by all who looked through it. He apparently gave it Idril, who in turn gave it to her son Eärendil; and from there it is said that it went over the sea with Enerdhil.[1]

 Other versions of the legendarium 
In earlier versions of the Middle-earth legendarium, the ""Elessar gem"" was made not by Enerdhil but by Celebrimbor, son of Curufin of Eregion.

Annael was a Sindarin elf who lived with his people in the caves of Androth in the region of Hithlum called Mithrim, in northern Beleriand in northwestern Middle-earth. He was known for fostering Tuor in his youth.

 Biography 
Annael was mentioned only shortly in ""Narn i Chîn Húrin"", the Tale of Húrin's Children, as the caretaker of Tuor, son of Huor, a Man of the House of Hador, after his mother Rían sent him there. Rían then went northwards to the Haudh-en-Ndengin, the Hill of the Fallen, where her husband Huor had fallen in the fifth battle of Beleriand, the Nirnaeth Arnoediad, and she lay down and died.
When Tuor was sixteen and able to fight, he desired to avenge the suffering and death of his people by the enemy but Annael restrained him from any rash action. Instead, Annael told him of his peoples' intention to leave the caves and escape into the south through the Gate of the Noldor, and it was from here that he first learned of King Turgon and Gondolin.
When Annael's people left Androth, they were ambushed by a force of Easterlings under their chief Lorgan, and they took Tuor a slave. Annael survived the attack and he and his people eventually came to Círdan in the southern part of the Beleriand.[1][2] His fate is unknown.

    A Mahud seen in The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King  
Mahud is the name given to the Men of Far Harad who rode, or ""piloted"", the Mûmaks (Oliphaunts). 
The term was coined by Games Workshop, and as such is non-canonical.

 History 
The Men of Far Harad were given no specific name by J.R.R. Tolkien, but Games-Workshop decided to call them ""Mahud"", perhaps inspired by Indian elephant-tamers called ""mahout"". As depicted in Peter Jackson's movies, they were the Men who first tamed the Mûmakil, but also they have a population of Half-trolls with pupil-black skin, blood-red tongues, and snowy-white eyes. The ""Mahud"" dwelt in jungles that lay in the south of Harad.

Éothéod



Forthwini was the son of Marhwini and the second Lord of the Éothéod.

 Biography 
Like his father before him, Forthwini lived in troubled times with all the lands east of the Misty Mountains still in danger of invasion from the tribes of the Easterlings. Certain that they were rearming for war, he went to King Ondoher of Gondor with a warning of this and soon they prepared for war. The Éothéod joined them and came to the aid of the Northern Army near the Black Gate, but they were defeated and the Éothéod retreated. The battle claimed the lives of Ondoher and his two sons but the Southern Army won and the Easterlings were defeated. Forthwini's fate is unknown but as he was Lord of the Éothéod it is possible that he accompanied them to the battle and was slain.[1]

""He wore a tall pointed blue hat, a long grey cloak, and a silver scarf. He had a long white beard and bushy eyebrows that stuck out beyond the brim of his hat.""
—The Fellowship of the Ring, ""A Long-expected Party""

Gandalf (Norse; IPA: [gand:alf] - ""Elf of the Wand"" or ""Wand-elf"") the Grey, later known as Gandalf the White, and originally named Olórin (Quenya; IPA: [oˈloːrin] - ""Dreamer"" or ""Of Dreams""), was an Istar (Wizard), sent to Middle-earth in the Third Age to combat the threat of Sauron. He joined Thorin and his company to reclaim the Lonely Mountain from Smaug, convoked the Fellowship of the Ring to destroy the One Ring, and led the Free Peoples in the final campaign of the War of the Ring.

 Biography 
 Years of the Lamps 
    Gandalf as a Maia named Olórin before leaving the Undying Lands  
Originally called Olórin, he was accounted as the wisest of the Maiar (with the possible exception of Melian). He was created by Ilúvatar before the Music of the Ainur[1], and was at the beginning of Time amongst the Ainur who entered into Eä.[2] In his ""youth,"" he became one of the Maiar who served Manwë, Varda, Irmo and Nienna named. He was associated with light and fire, much like his peer Varda.[3] Yet his ways often took him to Nienna, from whom he learned pity and patience. He loved the Elves, but he walked unseen among them, or wore a fana that appeared like an Elf, and sent them fair visions in their hearts that made them wiser. Throughout his existence, he followed the example of Nienna, he took pity on the sorrows of the Children of Ilúvatar and drove those who listened to him out of despair.[3]

    Gandalf in his 3 known forms: His Original form as a Maia named Olórin, As a form of an Elf when he was among them in Valinor, and his form in Middle Earth as Gandalf or ""Mithrandir."" (Art By Sepide Donne)  
When the Valar decided to send the order of the Istari (also known as Wizards) to Middle-earth, to counsel and assist all those who opposed the Dark Lord Sauron, Manwë and Varda decided to include Olórin among the five who were sent. At first, Olórin was nervous and described himself as too weak and too afraid of Sauron. Manwë understood, and told him that that was one main reason why he should go, to overcome that fear. Furthermore, the One Ring, the location of much of Sauron's power, presumably still existed somewhere. Thus, he insisted that Olórin should go as the third, but Varda convinced him not to include it as the third, but as the second.[4] He then agreed, and prepared for his departure from the Undying Lands with the other four, arriving about the same time the Necromancer appeared in Mirkwood.

 Third Age 
 Arrival in Middle-earth 
    Gandalf is received by Cirdan  
Olórin, like the other Wizards, took the shape of an old man. He was robed in grey and went about as a wanderer and counselor. At Mithlond he was welcomed by Glorfindel, his friend from Valinor, sent earlier on a similar mission, and Círdan the shipwright, who possessed Narya, one of the Three Elven Rings of Power. Círdan divined in Olórin a sense of strength and power despite his appearance as a bent and aged old man. Círdan gave Narya to Olórin with a prediction of his future struggles with evil, and a promise that it would support and aid him in his labours.[5]
He then began his sojourn in Middle-earth and during many years, he walked among the elves as a stranger, learning from them and teaching them. Unlike Saruman, Olórin did not take up a single permanent residence and never went to the east[6], apparently restricting his activities to the Westlands of Middle-earth, where the remnants of the Dúnedain and the Eldar remained to oppose Sauron. He was known by many names during the long years he wandered: Elves named him Mithrandir, the ""Grey Pilgrim,"" while the men of Arnor named him Gandalf, which became his most common name. He was also known as Incánus (in the south), and Tharkûn to the Dwarves.[4] He later revealed himself as one of the Istari, and eventually became known as the wisest of and most powerful of that order.
A legend says that Gandalf was given by Yavanna the Elfstone of Eärendil, to bring to the peoples of Middle-earth as a token that the Valar had not forsaken them. He gave it to Galadriel, bearer of one of the Three Elven Rings and mighty among the Eldar, remarked prophetically that she would in turn pass it to an individual who would also be called Elessar.[7]

 Reemergence of the Necromancer 
    Gandalf investigating Dol Guldur  
Around year 1100, when the Istari and Eldar discovered that some evil entity resided in at Dol Guldur in Mirkwood, while some thought a Nazgûl had returned to torment the world, or some new evil was arising, Gandalf began to suspect that perhaps Sauron himself might have returned.[5][8] As in the next two hundred years, evil continued to grow and spread, as well as the source directing it, Gandalf went to Dol Guldur in 2063 to discover its secret.[5] The Necromancer fled before him preventing Gandalf from identifying him.[8] After Gandalf's incursion, the evil there seemed to desist, and its absence allowed for some centuries of calmness.[8]
That peaceful period was known as the Watchful Peace and lasted for almost four hundred years, but the Nazgûl had used this period to prepare for Sauron's return, in 2460.[5] Realising the returning evil, Galadriel formed and reunited the White Council three years later composed of four members: Herself, Gandalf, Saruman and Elrond the Half-elven and bearer of other of the Three Rings. Galadriel wished Gandalf to be the chief of the Council, but he refused the position wishing to set down no roots and to maintain his independence; while Saruman took this place because of his vast knowledge and for his pride in not declining from the position.[8] However, he later grew jealous and afraid of Gandalf,[5] which was the reason of his future betrayal.

    Gandalf giving a fireworks display at Old Took's party in the Shire  
During his wanderings in Eriador, Gandalf met and befriended the isolated and secretive people of the Hobbits in their country, The Shire. During the Long Winter of 2758 Gandalf came to their aid.[5] It was then when he witnessed and admired the pity and courage the humble Hobbits reserved in their hearts.[9] 
He then passed on to visit the Shire occasionally and participate in the Midsummer-eve parties of the Old Took, where he impressed young Hobbits with his fireworks, and his stories about Dragons, Goblins and princesses.[9] He was thus known to be ""responsible for so many quiet lads and lasses going off into the Blue for mad adventures."" He also met a relatively adventurous Hobbit named Bilbo Baggins, although he was far from ""adventuresome.""[10]

    Gandalf finds Thrain in the dungeons of Dol Guldur  
When King Thráin II, a dwarf of the royal line of Lonely Mountain, disappeared on journey to Erebor, Gandalf looked for him. At some point after 2845 he entered the abandoned city of Khazad-dûm. After his vain search the Wizard exited through the Doors of Durin; however this experience did not help him know how to open the doors from the outside.[11] In 2850, his quest led him once more to Dol Guldur, this time in secrecy.[5] He found Thráin in the dungeons, who gave the Wizard his last possessions, the map and key to Erebor.[12] Most importantly, he found out that the Necromancer was not a Nazgûl – it was Sauron himself, and he had taken the last of the Seven Rings from the Dwarf King; Sauron was gathering the remaining Rings of Power and possibly searching for his lost One Ring.

    The White Council meeting on the question of Dol Guldur  
Gandalf escaped Dol Guldur and returned to the White Council.[8] After relating his discoveries, he urged the council to attack Sauron while the One Ring was still lost and Sauron's power immature. But Saruman said that it was better to watch and wait; that the One Ring had long ago rolled from Anduin to the Sea. The majority of the council agreed with Saruman. Elrond later privately told Gandalf he had a foreboding that the Ring would be found, and that the war to end the Age was coming. Indeed, Elrond added, he feared that it would end in darkness and despair. Gandalf encouraged him, saying there were many ""strange chances,"" and that, ""help oft shall come from the hands of the weak."" Gandalf did not yet realise that Saruman now wanted the Ring for himself and was secretly searching for it along the banks of river Anduin.
As time went on, the wizard became increasingly troubled by his knowledge of Sauron's resurgent strength. He knew that Sauron was already plotting war from Dol Guldur, and that as soon as he felt strong enough, he would attack Rivendell. Unfortunately, the only power left besides Rivendell to resist an attempt from Mirkwood to regain the lands of Angmar was the dwarves of the Iron Hills.

 Quest of Erebor 
Main article: Quest of Erebor

 Conception of a plan 
Over the years, Gandalf became concerned about the weak state of the North. Smaug the Dragon had destroyed both the Kingdom under the Mountain and the town of Dale, and the wizard feared that Sauron might use the desolation around Erebor to regain the northern passes in the mountains and the old lands of Angmar. Gandalf knew that exiled Dwarf King of Durin's Folk Thorin Oakenshield planned to battle against Smaug, but he knew that it would not be enough. In 2941,[5] while staying the night in Bree, Gandalf happened across the Dwarf King.[9] Thorin initiated conversation; he had been having a strange feeling urging him to seek Gandalf. The same was intrigued, for he had thought to seek Thorin as well. They found they were taking the same road for a while (Thorin passing through the Shire on his way to the Ered Luin), and they agreed to travel together. Thorin wanted advice, and Gandalf in turn wanted to discuss the Dragon Smaug with Thorin.
Ultimately, Gandalf concocted a plan wherein Thorin could destroy Smaug and recover his family fortune, albeit with a ""burglar"" of Gandalf's own choosing.

 Leading the company 
    Gandalf invites Bilbo on an adventure  
Feeling that a Hobbit should be involved, Gandalf remembered Bilbo Baggins. At first he found only Holman Cotton as Bilbo had left on the occasion of the Elven new year, something that persuaded Gandalf that Bilbo was the right person for the job.[9] He visited Bilbo later, bringing along the kinsmen of Thorin.[10] In the end, Gandalf convinced the reluctant Baggins to become a burglar for Thorin. Gandalf then accompanied Thorin and Company to Rivendell. During the journey Gandalf was instrumental in saving the travellers' lives from several calamities. He saved them from a trio of Stone-trolls, and later obtained the legendary sword Glamdring from their Troll-hoard; Gandalf bore it thenceforth.[13]
He also helped Thorin and Company through the Misty Mountains; when unknowingly they camped in the Front Porch of the Goblin-town, the same captured the whole company except Gandalf, who surprised them much later, killing the Great Goblin and then leading the Dwarves to the exit.[14] It was during this time that Bilbo obtained a ""magic ring.""[15] Bilbo initially claimed he ""won"" it from the creature ""Gollum"" while the company was under the Misty Mountains.[16] The ring conferred invisibility on Bilbo when he wore it, and he kept it secret from Gandalf for some time.
On their escape out, the Company was saved by the Eagles of the Misty Mountains; Gandalf once had healed the Great Eagle from a poisoned wound, and thenceforth they became friends. The Eagles picked them up to their eyrie, and the next day they dropped them to the other side of the Mountains.[16]

 Pressing Business 
    Assault on Dol Guldur  Gandalf then sought the hospitality of Beorn, persuading him to welcome and host the whole Company in his hall. But then he left the quest prior to its completion; after leading the Company to the outskirts of the Forest Gate, he gave them some final advice (but little did he know that the lands had changed by then) before they'd enter Mirkwood, and went to attend other obligations.[17][18] The White Council had met under the gravest of circumstances: Sauron's vast power was returning, even without his Ring. Gandalf at last convinced the Council to attack Dol Guldur, to which even Saruman agreed (as by now he feared Sauron as a rival, and wished to delay his search for the Ring). Gandalf joined his peers in assailing Dol Guldur, ridding Mirkwood of the Necromancer's presence, who fled to Mordor to his long-prepared stronghold of Barad-dûr.[19] When he was about to finish his task, news about what happened to Thorin's Company in Mirkwood reached him, and realised that the instructions he gave did not help them; they had lost their way, and then vanished from the imprisonment of the Wood-elves, who had captured them. He was anxious to get back to them as soon as possible.[20]
 The Battle of Five Armies 
    Gandalf fighting at the Battle of Five Armies  
Meanwhile Thorin's quest was successful: Erebor was retaken and Smaug was killed,[21] but when Gandalf finally arrived to the area, he found the Dwarves of Erebor and the Iron Hills preparing for an attack by the Lake-men and the Elves of Mirkwood. He was with Bard and Thranduil and revealed his presence trying to reason with Thorin. When the attack was beginning, Gandalf halted them, to warn that the Orcs and Wargs were coming to claim the treasure. He invited Dáin Ironfoot for council, and soon Dwarves, Elves and Men formed an alliance, and defeated the Orcs of the Misty Mountains in the Battle of Five Armies.[22]
King Thorin was mortally wounded and after his funeral and the reestablishment of Erebor under Dáin, Bilbo and Gandalf followed their way back; they celebrated Yule at Beorn's, and then returned to Rivendell, where he discussed with Elrond the events of Dol Guldur and the Lonely Mountain. Gandalf had accomplished his immediate goal, which was to destroy Smaug, who could have been used to disastrous effect by Sauron. A large number of Orcs and Wargs also were killed in the North, removing threats to Rivendell and Lothlórien.[9] But they both agreed that it would be better if the Necromancer were banished from the world altogether.[23]
As Gandalf and Bilbo passed by the site of their former encounter with the stone-trolls, they made sure to recover the gold of the troll-hoard they had buried before leaving the hobbit on the Shire and leaving.[23] Gandalf, for his part, found himself amazed by the hobbit; until then the wise had paid no attention to hobbits and knew little of them. For the rest of his sojourn in Middle-earth, Gandalf took a special interest in hobbits, and particularly in the Baggins family.

 Return of the Shadow 
    The White Council's last reunion, as illustrated by Alan Lee  
Despite the Council's hopes, Sauron was not weakened by this attack. He had foreseen the move that drove him from Mirkwood, and his retreat was but a feint. Ten years after the attack, Sauron declared himself openly in Mordor in 2951 and rebuilt the Barad-dûr. The White Council met for one last time in 2953 to debate about the Rings of Power. Saruman quieted his peers claiming to have the knowledge that the One Ring was lost in the Belegaer. After their meeting, Saruman, jealous and afraid of Gandalf, set spies to watch all his movements; this would affect the peaceful Hobbits, as Saruman thus discovered the existence and noted Gandalf's interest in the Shire, and started sending agents in Bree and the Southfarthing.[5]
In 2956, Gandalf met Aragorn, the hidden Heir of Isildur , and soon became friends with him. From that point on Aragorn and Gandalf often worked together towards a common end - the defeat of Sauron.

 Return to the Shire
During this period Gandalf visited the Shire frequently, especially his friend Bilbo Baggins, and his younger nephew, Frodo. He noted Bilbo's unusual youthfulness, despite his advancing age; the suspicious ""magic ring"" that Bilbo had acquired during his adventure began to weigh on his mind. Gandalf recalled the deceit Bilbo used in originally claiming it for his own -- Bilbo had later admitted to stealing it from Gollum. Gandalf could see that Bilbo was now very preoccupied with the ring and had begun to suspect that the same was indeed a ring of power. Such un-hobbitlike behaviour aroused his suspicions.

    Gandalf returning to the Shire  
In 3001, Bilbo planned what would become known as his Farewell Birthday Party, and at the culmination of the hobbit's speech, Bilbo put on the mysterious ring and disappeared, as a joke on his neighbours. Later as he was bidding farewell to Gandalf, who had known about his plans to leave, Bilbo began to change his mind about leaving his ring to Frodo, as he had earlier agreed. When Gandalf tried to persuade him to leave it, Bilbo became hostile and accused Gandalf of trying to steal the ring for his own benefit, which he referred to as his ""precious."" Horrified by Bilbo's outburst, Gandalf stood to his full height and projected his power, frightening the hobbit. This brought Bilbo back to his senses; he apologised, admitted that the Ring had been troubling him lately, and left it behind. Bilbo and Gandalf bid each other goodbye before Bilbo left the Shire for his journey.[24] Before leaving the Shire, he convinced Bilbo to leave the Ring for Frodo. He then emphatically warned Frodo not to use it; Gandalf .[25]

 One Ring's Search 
    Gandalf searching for answers in Minas Tirith  
Keen now to find out more about Gollum, he sought Aragorn's help to capture him. Studying the records in Minas Tirith, he found the Scroll of Isildur and pieced together the missing history of the One Ring; on his way back to the Shire he got word from the Galadhrim that Aragorn had finally captured Gollum and he went to Mirkwood to meet him. For days he interrogated him in order to verify what he already knew, in 3017. A great fear came over him when he learned that Gollum had been to the Barad-dûr. Sauron had tortured Gollum and learned not only of the ""magic ring,"" but also the names ""Shire"" and ""Baggins."" Gandalf left Mirkwood soon after, and left Gollum with the wood-elves of Northern Mirkwood.[5] He now returned in haste to the Shire, certain that Frodo's ring was not simply a ring of power: it was the One Ruling Ring of Sauron.

 War of the Ring 
Main article: War of the Ring

    Gandalf telling Frodo about the Ring  
Upon returning to the Shire, Gandalf immediately went to Frodo and confirmed his suspicions by throwing the Ring into Frodo's hearth fire, which revealed, in Black Speech, the inscription upon the ring. Gandalf then told a dumbfounded Frodo about the One Ring and its history, and how Sauron would seek to regain it. Instructing Frodo to go to Rivendell with the ring, Gandalf told him to make arrangements to leave the Shire quietly.
While in the Shire, he had a sense of foreboding and in the aftermath of Sauron's attack on Osgiliath Gandalf heard disturbing news about war in Gondor and a Black Shadow. He started wandering around Eriador hearing news from the refugees who had a fear they could not speak about, until he met Radagast the Brown who brought a message of Saruman that he must seek him at once; and a warning that the Ringwraiths are looking for the Shire.[26] He went to the Prancing Pony at Bree. Believing that he would not be able to return to Frodo in time, he wrote a letter, urging him to move as soon as possible for Rivendell, and seek someone ""Strider"" whose real name is Aragorn, with a riddle to identify him; Gandalf would then try to catch up with them when available. He also instructed Barliman Butterbur to send the letter to Hobbiton and to expect a Mr. Baggins that will come under the name of ""Mr. Underhill."" He left the inn, but Barliman would forget to send the letter.[27]

 Saruman's betrayal 
    Gandalf being rescued at Isengard  
Soon thereafter Gandalf arrived at Isengard. At their meeting, Saruman at last revealed his desire for the One Ring. He offered to his ""old friend and helper"" that they take the Ring for themselves and seize power from Sauron. Gandalf rejected this with horror, and was imprisoned by Saruman on the pinnacle of Orthanc. Gwaihir, chief of the Eagles, soon arrived and helped Gandalf escape. Gwaihir's real purpose for visiting Orthanc was to report a sighting of the Nazgûl, as Radagast had appealed to him to do so earlier on. Gandalf knew he must return quickly to the Shire, as Frodo (and the ring) were in grave danger from both Sauron's Nazgûl and now Saruman's treacherous desire for the ring.

 Journey to Rivendell 
Gandalf hurriedly went to Rohan, desiring to find a strong steed; there he obtained Shadowfax from King Théoden, who later resented the gift. This lord of horses and Gandalf forged a special bond, and Gandalf made quick use of Shadowfax's incredible strength and endurance.
Gandalf sped to the Shire. Fortunately, Frodo had already left the Shire without waiting for Gandalf, and was seeking the refuge of Rivendell. Upon arrival Gandalf learned that the Nazgûl, arrayed as Black Riders, had been searching the area. Dismayed, he set out for Bree; Barliman apologised to Gandalf for forgetting to send the letter, worried that the hobbits had left with Strider, the suspicious Ranger. But for Gandalf this was a hope which far exceeded his expectations. After congratulating a puzzled Barliman, and blessing his beer, Gandalf then made for Weathertop, a high point in the region, to observe the surrounding area.

    Gandalf fighting the Nazgûl, as illustrated by Ted Nasmith  
There he was assaulted at night by the Nazgûl, but drove them off after a great battle of light and flame. These phenomena were seen by Aragorn and the hobbits from afar, without knowing it was Gandalf. Before leaving, he marked some stones with the certh G for them to find.
Several days later, Frodo, Aragorn, and company stayed at Weathertop and were confronted by the remaining five Nazgûl. Despite their escape, Frodo was stabbed in the process by the Ringwraith leader with a Morgul-knife.[28] Gandalf was able to evade the four Nazgûl and successfully reach Rivendell and welcomed by Glorfindel. However, several days later, an injured Frodo arrived at the Ford of Bruinen, though the Nazgûl pursued him all the way there. Gandalf, along with Elrond, saved Frodo from the Nazgûl by enchanting the water and sweeping them away.[29]

 Forming of the Fellowship 
    Gandalf reciting the Ring-verse in the Black Speech at the Council of Elrond  
Elrond called a council after Frodo was healed to consider the momentous decision regarding the ring. There Gandalf explained to the others how Saruman had imprisoned him and how the White Wizard was creating his own army of orcs to rival Sauron's.[26] By chance, representatives of most of the free peoples happened to be in Rivendell already for various reasons. Elrond and Gandalf advised that the Ring should be destroyed in the fires of Orodruin, where it was made. Others dissented or objected, but eventually submitted to Gandalf's plan. Ultimately, Elrond appointed the Fellowship of the Ring as nine walkers, numerically set against Sauron's nine Nazgûl. The relatively small number reflected the realisation by Elrond and the other council members that the quest of Mount Doom would not rely upon strength of arms, but on stealth and good fortune. Gandalf was chosen to lead the company, which included Aragorn, Boromir, Legolas the Elf, Gimli the Dwarf, and the hobbits Frodo, Samwise Gamgee, Peregrin Took, and Meriadoc Brandybuck.

    Gandalf leading the Fellowship through Eregion  
Several obstacles stood in the company's way. The vast Misty Mountains had to be crossed, for Gandalf was determined not to lead the company near Isengard. Gandalf decided to take a southern route to the Redhorn Pass and there to cross the Misty Mountains near Caradhras, thereby traversing the mountain range and avoiding Isengard. When this attempt failed due to a terrible storm he then decided to take the Fellowship through the ruins of Moria, where the remains of the great Dwarf city of Khazad-dûm was now a labyrinth of tunnels under the mountains. Others in the company were loathe enter the maze, as it was now the lair of orcs and something known only as ""Durin's Bane.""

 Fall in Mines of Moria 
At the Doors of Durin on the west side of the mountains, Gandalf, after some delay, spoke the password and led the company into the dark. Having been in Moria on an earlier perilous errand, he was somewhat familiar with the underground passages. Eventually the party came to the Chamber of Mazarbul, where Gandalf read the Book of Records, which revealed the fate of Balin, the leader of an ill-fated attempt to re-colonise Moria. Soon after, the party was attacked by orcs, and forced to flee the chamber. By then Gandalf was well aware of their location, and he led the party quickly towards the eastern exit.
You cannot pass,"" he said. The orcs stood still, and a dead silence fell. ""I am a servant of the Secret Fire, wielder of the flame of Anor. You cannot pass. The dark fire will not avail you, flame of Udûn. Go back to the Shadow! You cannot pass.—The Lord of the Rings, The Fellowship of the Ring, Book II, Chapter 5: ""The Bridge of Khazad-dûm""

    Gandalf and the Balrog  
Unfortunately Durin's Bane caught up to the group at the Bridge of Khazad-dûm. Gandalf and Legolas immediately realised what it was: a Balrog of Morgoth, a servant of the first dark lord. In a spectacular display of bravery Gandalf faced the demon and broke the bridge both stood upon, leaving the beast to fall into a seemingly bottomless chasm. But the Balrog's whip lashed out, and grasped Gandalf by the knees, causing him to fall into the pit. While falling, Gandalf shouted ""Fly, you fools"" and vanished into the abyss.[30]

    Gandalf battling the Balrog on Durin's Tower  
Yet Gandalf did not die; he and the Balrog fell for a long time, and wizard was burned by the Balrog's fire. Then they plunged into a deep lake in the depths of the mountain, which Gandalf later said was cold as the tide of death and almost froze his heart. They fought in the water until finally the Balrog fled into dark tunnels, where the world is gnawed by nameless things, older even than Sauron. Gandalf pursued the creature until it led him to the spiraling Endless Stair, and they climbed it until they reached Durin's Tower in the living rock of Zirakzigil, the pinnacle of the Silvertine above the clouds. There they fought, until at last Gandalf threw down his enemy, and the Balrog broke the mountain-side as it fell. Then darkness took Gandalf, and he passed away. His body lay on the peak. The entire battle, from the confrontation on the Bridge of Khazad-dûm to the mutual demise of the Balrog and Gandalf, had taken ten days.

 Ressurrection 
Then darkness took me, and I strayed out of thought and time, and I wandered far on roads that I will not tell... Naked I was sent back – for a brief time, until my task is done. And naked I lay upon the mountain-top. … There I lay staring upward, while the stars wheeled over, and each day was as long as a life-age of the earth.—The Lord of the Rings, The Two Towers, Book Three, Chapter V: ""The White Rider""But Gandalf's spirit did not depart Middle-earth forever at this time. As the only one of the five Istari to stay true to his errand, Olórin/Gandalf was sent back to mortal lands by Eru, and he became Gandalf once again. Yet, as he was now the sole emissary of the Valar to Middle-earth, he was granted the power to ""reveal"" more of his inner Maiar strength. This naked power that lay within him was seldom used during the remainder of his time in Middle-earth, as his mission was essentially the same: to support and succour those who opposed Sauron. Nevertheless, when Gandalf's wrath was kindled his ""unveiled"" strength was such that few of Sauron's servants could withstand him.
Three days later he was found by the windlord Gwaihir, the Lord of the Eagles, who had been sent by Galadriel to find him. Gandalf was carried to Caras Galadhon in Lothlórien, where he was healed, given a new staff, and clothed in white, and thus became Gandalf the White. He soon learned that Frodo and Sam had left the Fellowship and were attempting the quest of Mount Doom alone.

 War in Rohan 
    Gandalf confronting Théoden, controlled by Saruman  
As Frodo was beyond his assistance now, Gandalf promptly went south to Fangorn Forest, where he met the Three Hunters: Aragorn, Legolas, and Gimli, and gave them messages from Galadriel. Then he called forth Shadowfax, a Mearas, and rode with them to Edoras, capital of Rohan. There he found that Saruman's spy Gríma Wormtongue had deceived King Théoden into hopeless impotence, and Saruman had put Théoden under a spell. Gandalf quickly deposed Wormtongue and freed Théoden and encouraged Théoden to ride west to war against Saruman. Gandalf by now was keenly aware that the great war to end the age was beginning; if Saruman conquered Rohan, then Gondor would be alone with enemies on all sides.[31][32]
Keep well the Lord of the Mark, till I return. Await me at Helm's Gate. Farewell!—Gandalf to Aragorn and Éomer and the men of the king's household

    Gandalf the White returns, at Helm's Deep  
At Gandalf's encouragement King Théoden went west to Helm's Deep where he was quickly besieged; Gandalf then searched for Erkenbrand and the forces of the Westfold, which he later found and led to the Deep, thus breaking the siege. Meanwhile, the Ents (along with the hobbits Merry and Pippin) moved against Saruman and sent Huorns against the orcs, resulting in the utter ruin of the outer walls of Isengard and the complete annihilation of Saruman's orcs. After the battle, Gandalf went to Orthanc with Théoden, Aragorn, and a small group. There Saruman rejected Gandalf's offer of forgiveness with contempt. Gandalf then broke Saruman's staff and cast him from the Order and the Council. Gandalf imposed a strict watch on Isengard by the Ents and then advised King Théoden to ride to Gondor's defence as soon as possible. The wizard's mind had already turned to Gondor and the coming climactic battle in the east.[33]

 Siege of Gondor 
    Gandalf saves the Osgiliath force  
As a 'reward' for Pippin, who had foolishly gazed into a palantír, Gandalf took the Hobbit with him to Minas Tirith, the last bastion of the west. Soon after arriving, Gandalf confronted Denethor II, the Ruling Steward, and learned that he was near despair over the death of his eldest son, Boromir. Pippin entered the Steward's service in payment of the debt that he and Merry owed, the death of Boromir. Ostensibly they were allies, but the Steward treated him with disrespect and suspicion. When Faramir, the Steward's younger son, returned from Osgiliath and was attacked by Nazgûl, Gandalf upon Shadowfax drove them away by revealing the power within him; later Faramir told him that Frodo and Sam were still alive and headed towards Mordor.

    Gandalf faces the Witch-king of Angmar  
The city was soon besieged by a vast force from Mordor, led by the Witch-king of Angmar. An ill-advised counter attack resulted in Faramir receiving a wound from a poisoned dart; he lay near death inside the Tower. Still, Gandalf encouraged the men of Minas Tirith to have hope, and dispelled the fear of the Ringwraiths by his very presence. But Sauron's catapults hurled flaming bolts upon the city; soon the first circle of the city burned unchecked. Denethor now lost all heart as the city burned and his only remaining son hovered near death; he abandoned his leadership of the city. Gandalf then took it upon himself to direct the defense of the city. When the gigantic ram Grond destroyed the ancient entrance to the city, Gandalf placed himself alone at the ruined gateway. The Witch-king then appeared in the midst of the blasted gate upon a black horse and threatened Gandalf with death; but Gandalf did not move — seated upon Shadowfax he defied the mightiest of Sauron's minions. However, the stand-off ended inconclusively, as the morning arrived along with the host of the Rohirrim. Hearing the horns of the Riders of Rohan, the Witch-king departed.
But Gandalf did not pursue his foe, for Pippin brought him news that Denethor was about to commit suicide in the high tower, burning himself and his son Faramir on a pyre like the heathen Kings of old. Gandalf rushed to stop this madness and was able to save Faramir, but not Denethor, whose despair and grief had overcome his mind. Gandalf also learned how it was that Denethor's will had been broken: Denethor clutched a palantír in his hands as he burned. Clearly Denethor had been using the stone's special properties for some time — extending his vision far beyond those of mannish eyes, but also wrestling in thought with Sauron. And even though Sauron could not completely overwhelm Denethor's mind, his courage was daunted by knowledge of the vast might of Mordor. Thus the shadow entered into the capital of Gondor.
Nevertheless, and against all hope, the siege was broken. Éowyn of Rohan and the hobbit Merry defeated the Witch-king, whose last wail was heard by many as he was reduced to impotence. Soon after, Lord Aragorn arrived with a large valour of men from the southern fiefs upon a captured pirate fleet from Umbar. The forces of the men of the west then utterly defeated Sauron's attack against Minas Tirith, relieving the city and killing virtually all of the invaders. Gandalf's carefully laid plans and words of wisdom, along with acts of heroism not seen since the elder days, had defeated Sauron's first move.

 The Fall of Sauron 
In Minas Tirith, Gandalf was selected by Aragorn, Imrahil, and Éomer (the remaining lords of the west) to be their leader in the coming final battles. This would be the culmination of Gandalf's efforts in Middle-earth. Fully aware that the west would stand or fall on the outcome of Frodo's mission, he advised the lords to drive north to the Morannon, thereby drawing Sauron's eye away from Frodo's likely location. This plan surely would result in a catastrophic loss for the outnumbered army, but it gave Frodo a chance to achieve the quest of Mount Doom.

    Gandalf in the final battle at the Black Gate of Mordor  
Led by Gandalf and Aragorn, the army of the West crossed the Anduin and marched north, pausing occasionally to announce their coming and to dispatch small numbers of men to lesser tasks. Upon arriving at the Black Gate, the forces halted and prepared for battle. As they ordered their companies, the foul Mouth of Sauron rode forth to parley with them; he revealed Frodo's mithril-coat and Arnor-blade and implied that their owner was captured and tortured. The emissary of Sauron then proposed that the forces of the west surrender; Gandalf however was undaunted, and, seizing his friend's belongings, rejected Sauron's offer. In shock, the Mouth of Sauron turned back towards the Black Gate, which slowly opened to reveal a vast army of orcs and trolls advancing on the lords of the west. Sauron's trap was sprung.
Yet Sauron himself became the victim of Gandalf's trap. Unbeknownst to all, Frodo and Sam had succeeded in scaling Mount Doom and even as the Battle of Morannon began Frodo stood at the Crack of Doom. But the power and lure of the ring finally overcame his will and he placed the ring upon his finger, claiming it as his own. Immediately the Nazgûl were summoned by their lord, as he in terror realised his blunder: his enemies intended to destroy his ring.

    Gandalf with Gwaihir rescues Frodo and Sam  
But Gandalf's foresight proved accurate again as the creature Gollum, who had been doggedly following the Ring-bearer, seized the ring from Frodo, and, while celebrating his reunion with ""his precious,"" unwittingly fell into the fires of Orodruin. The ring was unmade as the fiery mountain erupted. The tower of Barad-dûr and the Towers of the Teeth began to collapse, their foundations crumbling, the Ring-wraiths burned out like shooting stars, and Sauron was reduced to a mere shadow of malice, never to torment the world again. With Sauron gone, his forces scattered like frightened insects; the Men of the West now set upon them with fury. Gandalf announced the success of the Ring-bearer and the end of Sauron; the quest had been fulfilled. Seeing that victory was achieved, Gandalf then mounted on Gwaihir the Eagle for a third time, and set out to see if Frodo and Samwise had survived the tumults of Mount Doom. To his great relief, the two were found on the slopes of Orodruin, clinging to life amid the volcanic eruptions. The great quest was over.

 Fourth Age 
In Minas Tirith, Gandalf and the remaining members of the Fellowship reunited. At the coronation of King Elessar, Gandalf (at Aragorn’s request) set the crown upon the King’s head, and declared, ""Now come the days of the King, and may they be blessed while the thrones of the Valar endure!"" Thus Gandalf ushered in the new age of men.
After the coronation and wedding of Aragorn to Arwen, Gandalf left with the rest of the remaining Fellowship on the journey home. For Gandalf, it was his last long journey in Middle-earth. His errand to Arda had been fulfilled; Sauron had been defeated. He said farewell to his friends one by one until at last only the four Hobbits remained at his side. At the borders of the Shire he, too, turned away. He left the Hobbits to settle with the Shire, for the shattered pieces of evil still remaining in the world were no longer his concern, and went to talk to ""moss gatherer"" Tom Bombadil.

    Departing from Middle-earth  
What Gandalf did during the next two years is unknown; it is possible that his ""long talk"" with Bombadil was just that. At any rate, on 29 September 3021, he met Frodo at Mithlond, ready to take the White Ship over the sea to Aman. He wore Narya openly on his finger, and Shadowfax was beside him (perhaps even to take ship with him). His mission was over, and his homecoming after more than 2000 years was nigh. He bade farewell to Samwise, Merry, and Pippin (the latter two of whom he had forewarned of the passage), then boarded the ship beside Frodo, Bilbo, Elrond, and was never seen again in Middle-earth.[34]
The ship passed west upon the sea, and then took the hidden straight path to Valinor: Gandalf became Olórin once more. There, presumably, he dwells still in the gardens of Irmo. Olórin, the wisest of the Maiar and the sole Istar to remain true to his mission, had successfully kindled the hearts of the free people in Middle-earth to overcome the evil of their time. In a large way, it was his victory.

 Etymology 
The name Gandalf means ""Elf of the wand"" or ""Wand-elf,"" from old northern Mannish.
Within Tolkien's legendarium, ""Gandalf"" is a mysterious name of the meaning ""Wand-Elf"" (alternatively cane/staff) in old northern Mannish. Most denizens of Middle-earth incorrectly assumed Gandalf was a Man (human), although he was really a Maia spirit (equivalent to an angel).
The name Gandalf is originally from the ""Dvergatal,"" a list of Dwarf-names found in the Völuspá poem of Norse Mythology, from which the names of Thorin and his fellow Dwarves were also drawn.[35]

 Other names 
Olórin, his name in Valinor and in very ancient times. It comes from the Quenya olor or olos (""dream"").[36] The name could also be spelled as Olorion.[37]
Mithrandir, his Sindarin name, used in Gondor and by the Elves. It means ""Grey Pilgrim,"" from the Sindarin mith (""grey"") and ran (""wander"") or rhandir (""pilgrim"").[36][38]
Tharkûn, given by the Dwarves), which means ""Staff man.""[37]
Incánus, a name of unclear language and meaning. He must have acquired the name from one of his many travels in the south, near Harad.[37] Tolkien several times changed his mind about it, varying between the Latin word incanus (meaning Grey and a possible Westron invention meaning ""Greymantle""), a word Ind-cano (meaning Cruel Ruler), or even a form of Southron meaning ""Spy of the North.""
Old Greybeard, by the Mouth of Sauron when they meet at the Morannon. 
The White Rider (when mounted on the great horse Shadowfax)
Stormcrow (a reference to his arrival being associated with times of trouble), often used by his detractors to mean he is a troublesome meddler in the affairs of others.

 Character development 
Many that live deserve death. And some that die deserve life. Can you give it to them? Then do not be too eager to deal out death in judgment. For even the very wise cannot see all ends.—The Lord of the Rings, The Fellowship of the Ring, Book I, Chapter 2: ""The Shadow of the Past""

 Mythical roots 
The Old Norse name ""Gandalfr"" appears in the list of dwarves in the Völuspá of the Elder Edda; the name means ""cane-elf,"" or ""wand-elf."" J.R.R. Tolkien took the name along with the dwarves' names when he wrote The Hobbit in the 1930s. He came to regret the creation of this ""rabble of eddaic-named dwarves, [...] invented in an idle hour"" (The Return of the Shadow, pg. 452), since it forced him to come up with an explanation of why Old Norse names should be used in Third Age of Middle-earth. He solved the dilemma in 1942 by the explanation that Old Norse was a translation of the language of Dale. The figure of Gandalf has other influences from Germanic mythology, particularly Odin in his incarnation as ""the Wanderer,"" an old man with one eye, a long white beard, a wide brimmed hat, and a staff. Tolkien states that he thinks of Gandalf as an ""Odinic wanderer"" in a letter of 1946.[39]
Gandalf is also similar to Väinämöinen, a Bard in Finnish mythology.
Gandalf's equivalence to Merlin the Magician, of English Mythology, is discussed in episode two of the 2014 documentary Looking for the Hobbit, featuring French Arthurian expert Nicholas Mezzalira and Medieval specialist Leo Carruthers.

 Der Berggeist 
    Der Berggeist  
Tolkien had a postcard labelled Der Berggeist (""the mountain spirit""), and on the paper cover in which he kept it, he wrote ""origin of Gandalf"" at some point. The postcard reproduces a painting of a bearded figure, sitting on a rock under a pine tree in a mountainous setting. He wears a wide-brimmed round hat, and a long cloak and a white fawn is nuzzling his upturned hands. 
Humphrey Carpenter in his Biography said that Tolkien had bought the postcard during his 1911 holiday in Switzerland. However, Manfred Zimmerman (1983) discovered that the painting was by German artist Josef Madlener and dates to the late 1920s. Humphrey Carpenter concluded that Tolkien was probably mistaken about the origin of the postcard himself. Tolkien must have acquired the card at some time in the early 1930s, at a time when The Hobbit had already begun to take shape.[40]
The original painting was auctioned at Sotheby's in London on July 12, 2005 for 84,000. The previous owner had been given the painting by Madlener in the 1940s and recalled that he had stated the mountains in the painting's background were the Dolomites.

 Personality 
     
Gandalf is often described in The Lord of the Rings as quick to anger, and equally quick to laugh.[41] His deep wisdom and compassion clearly derived from the patience he learned in Valinor, just as his care for all creatures of good will must have come from his strong sense of pity for the weak. Both his patience and sense of pity were revealed again and again, extending even to the servants of his enemies.
Keen observers of Gandalf often detected a veiled power, usually revealed in his eyes, which appeared deep and wise. He was alternately affectionate and brusque; he often surprised others with his bluntness when time was of the essence. Gandalf consistently upbraided foolish behaviour, but also richly rewarded those who acted with good intentions.
Hobbits appealed to him more than to the other Wizards, and he went often to the Shire for respite from errands. His attachment was likely because the Shire was of more bliss and peace than other inhabited realms of Middle-earth.

 Appearance 
Gandalf is described as an old man with a pointed blue hat, a long grey cloak, and a silver scarf. He had a long white beard and bushy eyebrows that stuck out beyond the brim of the hat.
After he is resurrected, the change of his signature colour from grey to white is significant, for he was sent back to replace the corrupted head of the Order of Wizards and leader of the White Council Saruman as the Chief of the Order of Wizards. In the book, he says that he has himself become what Saruman should have been.
Círdan the Shipwright seemed to have foreseen this, for he entrusted the care of Narya, the Ring of Fire (one of the Three Rings of the Elves) to Gandalf rather than Saruman.

 Powers and abilities 
Gandalf is one of the wisest and most knowledgeable beings in Middle-earth, and believed by Galadriel to be more worthy than Saruman in leading the White Council. He has extensive knowledge of many languages and writing systems used in Middle-earth, as well as in the history and customs of several of its peoples. He considers himself the greatest scholar of Hobbit traditions. His long journeys have allowed him to meet many influential and powerful individuals and form lasting bonds with them. The Hobbits know him as a masterful crafter of firecrackers.
Outside of the Shire, however, Gandalf the Grey is revered as one of the most powerful and wisest beings to tread Middle-earth, although he was wary of confronting Saruman and Sauron directly, the latter also after his rebirth, as well as of the influence of the One Ring. He was considered the most powerful member of the Fellowship of the Ring, as well as, according to Aragorn, its leader, not in small part thanks to his encyclopedic knowledge. His vast intelligence allows him to accurately guess the thoughts of others, and makes him perhaps the preeminent architect of Sauron's defeat. He is often noted to have extremely sharp eyes which can see not only into darkness, but also into the dimension of wraiths, such as when he perceived the lingering effects of the Morgul-blade on Frodo as part of his body having become almost transparent. He also has a degree of extrasensory perception, which he demonstrated by feeling Durin's Bane while casting a spell.
Armed with an Elfin blade, Gandalf is as valiant a fighter as the other swordsmen in the Fellowship, in no way hindered by his elderly appearance when fighting or riding. He is rendered even more formidable by his magic. Gandalf the Grey has command over a great array of spells for all situations, such as to enhance Elrond's flood spell, giving the water the appearance of galloping knights, and seal doors shut or open them, although it should be noted that he was unable to open the Doors of Durin prior to remembering the password. He stated that Durin's Bane nearly overpowered him with its counter-spell, forcing him to rely on a word of Command that resulted in a blast which caused the ceiling of the room beyond the door to collapse.
Gandalf described himself as ""a servant of the Secret Fire, wielder of the flame of Anor."" Coincidentally, many of his spells are based on light and fire. He was able to light a faggot of wet wood simply with a touch of his staff, which he considered distinctive enough that any onlooker would recognize his handiwork. He can cause the tip of his staff to glow with bright white light so as to see in the dark and increase the radiance at will, as demonstrated in Moria. He later displays the ability to focus this light into a beam. When fighting a pack of wolves, he set fire to all treetops on a hill with a single blazing branch, and the air became so hot that an arrow burned mid-flight. At the cost of shattering his staff, he was able to conjure a sea of white flames that caused the bridge under the feet of Durin's Bane to crumble. Similar spells he displayed are: 
• Heating fire
• Manipulating sparks
• Creating massive pillars of smoke
Gandalf the White displays these same powers, but more advanced. When he first met Aragorn, Gimli, and Legolas in his new form, he shocked and quickly overpowered them with his agility and magic: he effortlessly disarmed the former two, one by causing his sword to burst into flames, the other by pulling the axe from his hands with a wave of his staff, and burnt the Elf's arrow into nothing when the latter loosed it. Shortly afterwards, he said that he had recently battled Sauron's eye to prevent him from locating Frodo, and although successful, the confrontation left him spent. He also displayed the ability to communicate with horses, and was able to reach Shadowfax with his mind. 
Finally, he also shattered Saruman’s staff, and stripped him of his divine power.
As his unrestricted form, Olorin, he had all his previous powers massively boosted, and the ability to shapeshift. However, even this form seems to have restrictions, as the Ainur were said to have their power restricted upon descending to earth. 

 Weapons 
Gandalf primarily used his staff, but also carried a sword in combat. Sometimes during combat, Gandalf would be seen wielding both weapons against his enemies.

 Staff 
Main article: Wizard Staff

Gandalf utilised his staff for various spells and abilities. He didn't use it just as a weapon; he also utilized a staff as if it were a walking stick. He initially had an old wooden staff which he lost in the Mines of Moria while fighting the Balrog. He used a new one upon becoming Gandalf the White.

 Glamdring 
Main article: Glamdring

This was an Elven sword Gandalf found in a troll cave. From that point until the resolution of the War of the Ring, he used this as a weapon to complement his staff, wielding them with equal skill. In many cases, he fought with both weapons at once.

 Portrayal in adaptations 
 The Hobbit and Lord of the Rings film trilogies 
Sir Ian McKellen portrayed Gandalf in the The Lord of the Rings film trilogy directed by Peter Jackson.
I gave you the chance of aiding me willingly, but you have elected the way of pain!—Saruman to Gandalf
Sean Connery was originally considered for the role of Gandalf, but turned it down because he didn't want to spend so long in New Zealand, where the film was shot; Tom Baker of Doctor Who fame, Patrick Stewart, Christopher Plummer, and David Bowie were also considered or approached[42]. McKellen's interpretation of the role was widely praised. He was nominated for an Academy Award for his portrayal of Gandalf in The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring, making him the only individual cast member to be nominated for his performance. Christopher Lee, a lifelong fan of Tolkien's works, had hoped to be cast as Gandalf, but due to his advancing age instead opted for the role of Saruman, as Gandalf would require horse riding and more swordsmanship.
Gandalf's staff in The Fellowship of the Ring film was sculpted by Brigitte Wuest, after a drawing by Alan Lee.[43]
Ian McKellen reprised his role of Gandalf the Grey for the three-part adaptation of The Hobbit, noting in early interviews that he preferred portraying Gandalf the Grey to Gandalf the White, as Gandalf the Grey required a more nuanced performance. He maintains, however, that he enjoyed playing both Gandalf's, but felt Gandalf the Grey was easier and calmer to portray.

Console Versions: PS2, Xbox, Gameboy Advance, Gandalf appears in the game The Lord of the Rings Fellowship of the Ring (2002) first introducing himself to Frodo Baggins and later on as a playable up until the fight against the Balrog which he leaves the party.

Two Towers, Return of the King and Third Age

Console Versions: PS2, Xbox and Gamecube
Gandalf appeared in the action adventure video games The Two Towers (2002) and The Return of the King (2003), both games follow Peter Jackson's Rings Movie Trilogy and the games were made by New Line Cinema (owned by Warner Bros.) published by EA Games and licensed by various companies such as Nintendo, Microsoft and Sony. Each Rings Trilogy actor reprised their original role and added voice to the character in the game. For Sir Ian McKellen who played Gandalf reprises his role of Gandalf and is narrator for both games. 
Gandalf is only playable in the The Two Towers Gameboy Advance game. While he is indeed in The Two Towers console video game, he is computer controlled and therefore is a non-playable character in the PS2, Xbox or Gamecube console versions of The Two Towers game. However, he is playable in The Return of the King video game for (PC, PS2, Xbox, Gamecube and Gameboy Advance.) He also appears in The Lord of the Rings: The Third Age (2004) video game based on the Lord of the Rings Movie Trilogy for (PS2, Xbox, Gamecube and Gameboy Advance) which is a turn-based game. In the console version he is an important ally in Berethor's quest; he is used twice when fighting specific enemies the game. For example in Eastern Moria as Gandalf the Grey, where the party will help him vanquish Durin's Bane (The Balrog of Moria) before the party exits the dwarf city. He also makes a one time appearance in a scene in the Plains of Rohan warning you of orcs that the party encounters along the path they're taking. You fight with him again in the Minas Tirith level, as Gandalf the White where the party aids him in fighting the Witch-king of Angmar.
The Gameboy Advance or handheld version of The Lord of the Rings: The Third Age follows a different style of gameplay while still being a turn-based game like the console versions. However major differences do occur between the console and handheld versions. The difference between the console and handheld versions is that in the console version you follow a character and form a fellowship along the way, and go through the same missions as the Fellowship of the Ring with variations of missions and alter in the story. The handheld version of The Third Age game takes a somewhat different approach while still retaining some similar features on the console version, but not entirely similar to the console version of the game. 
War of the Ring (video game) 2003
Similar to Age of Empires or Warcraft, Gandalf is a playable unit which the play can control on the Campaign maps.

The Lord of the Rings: The Third Age

According to The Lord of the Rings: The Third Age Gameboy Advance Manual it says the following:
""The game is organized into three episodes that corresponds to events from each of the three The Lord of the Rings movies. Each episode contains up to eight missions. By claiming victory in battle you unlock further missions in the storyline. After selecting NEW GAME from the Main Menu, the Commander screen appears. Choose between playing the forces of good and evil by selecting one of six commanders: Aragorn, Gandalf the White or Elrond on the side of the good, and Saruman the White, The Witch-King of Angmar or The Mouth of Sauron on the side of evil (page 7).""
Each of the Main Hero's or villains have special abilities that a player uses to there advantage in the game.
Gandalf has the following abilities each ability increases per level and are earned with EXP earned in battle:
Evasion - allows Hero +1 move through enemy units with no penalty
Stealth - Takes 33% less damage from missile attacks
Inspire - adds +1 command point per level to given command points the with the maximum of +2 command points +1 command point to each flank
Blinding Light- all enemies on Gandalf's flank may flee based on morale with higher likelihood per level
There is a Good Skill Set and a Evil Skill Set of Abilities for Good and Evil found in the pause menu during a mission they can be found in the Glossary. For example Unit Talents which are as follows: Elf Archery, Magic Attack, Double Move, Shrarpshooter, Regeneration, Shock, Trample, Inaccurate and Shieldmaiden. There are also Events that take place for example all of the following are events in the game that can take place at any time in a game: Free Move, Onslaught, Rally, Recovery, Disorder and Willpower and last but most importantly Items and are as follows: Kingsfoil, Lembas Bread, Elven Phial, Galadrim Lock, Entwater, Troll Meat, Hand of Saruman, Shelob Poison, Berkserker Root and Spoils of War.
The player enters a mission with a randomly given amount of command points (CP) to each flank, for example the side of Good has 1 CP on the left flank, 1 CP on the right flank and 5 CP in the middle once these numbers reach zero then Good ends its turn and Evil takes its turn and visa versa. With each turn each side is also given a free move which costs zero CP points to start and the CP number is green when a free move is available. Usually in the game on one side are the good units and on the other is evil with The One Ring's inscription as the boundary line between flanks. The terrain is indicated with an X which restricts a units movement, with shields indicating its protective value. 
As the player excels in the game at times certain missions will not require companions instead only the main hero or villain is required or in some cases a mission automatically already has a non-specfic Good or Evil commander provided. However, other missions in order to be successful companions are required to command flanks of units. The Companions for Good are as follows: Legolas, Gimli, Eoywn, Eomer, King Theoden, Boromir, Faramir and Haldir for the side of Good, and Shagrat, Sharku, Lurtz, Gothmog, Gorbag, Grishnakh, Ugluk and Grima Wormtonuge for Evil. The objective of the whole game is simple save or destroy Middle Earth.

The Hobbit Console and Handheld Games

Consoles: Windows, PS2, Xbox, Gamecube, and Gameboy Advance
Gandalf from J.R.R. Tolkien's book also makes in appearance in The Hobbit video game based on the book in 2003 by Sierria Entertainment released on Windows, PS2, Xbox, Gamecube, and Gameboy Advance.

Handheld Game Appearances

Consoles: Windows, Mac, Xbox 360, PS3, Playstation Vita, Nintendo 3DS, Nintendo DS Gandalf is also a very important character in The Battle for Middle-earth series. Making an appearance in both The Battle for Middle-earth (Only for PC/Windows) and The Battle for Middle-earth II (Only for Windows & Xbox 360) and is one of the most used heroes in the good campaign of The Battle for Middle-Earth. In The Battle for Middle-earth II, he is in none of the campaigns and is only used for skirmish and War of the Ring modes.
Another appearance Gandalf makes is in The Lord of the Rings: Conquest (For PS3, Xbox 360, Windows and Nintendo DS) as a mage type hero. Gandalf is used in the good campaign in Isengard to defeat and kill Saruman, the purification of Moria to kill the Balrog (this time with more power), the Siege of Minas Tirith to defend the city's higher gates from the forces of Mordor, and as one of the main heroes at the Battle of the Black Gate. In the Evil Campaign, the player kills Gandalf as Sauron and the last defense of the Shire thus Middle-Earth falls and is covered in second darkness.
Gandalf also appears in LEGO The Lord of the Rings: The Video Game (For Nintendo DS, Nintendo 3DS, Wii, Wii U, Playstation Vita, Microsoft Windows, Mac OS X, Xbox 360 and Playstation 3) and its sequel/prequel LEGO The Hobbit: The Video Game (For Playstation 3, Playstation 4, Playstation Vita, XBox 360, XBox One, Wii U, Nintendo 3DS, OS X, and Microsoft Windows) as a playable minifigure. Players will first be able to play as Gandalf in the level titled The Black Rider where he will fight Saruman in the throne room of Orthanc at Isengard. Gandalf's staff has similar abilities to Saruman's staff. It can lift and/or build LEGO objects, give off light in dark places, shoot out bolts of energy in battle, and make a shield that repels orcs and protects from most projectiles. Gandalf can also be unlocked as Gandalf the Grey and Gandalf the White in the former game; he has the same abilities either way. The game reuses audio of Ian Mckellen for Gandalf's dialogue.
Gandalf is also a playable character in LEGO Dimensions, and one of three characters included in the starter pack; the game also features various other Lord of the Rings characters and settings.

 Magic and Abilities 
Illumination

As Gandalf the Grey, Gandalf was not capable of very powerful spells, though he still had potency up to an extent. One of his simpler spells was illumination. In Moria, Gandalf was obliged to light his staff so that the Fellowship could find their way out of Moria. Because of the light provided by Gandalf's staff, the Fellowship was able to pass over many dangers and eventually find their way out of Moria safely.

Magical Kinesis

Gandalf the Grey was also capable of pushing his foes back with his staff, as shown in the movie when he battles Saruman in Orthanc. He tried to defeat Saruman as best as he could, but the White Wizard's power was too great for him to withstand. Eventually, Saruman stole Gandalf's staff and transported him to the top of Orthanc. In The Hobbit: The Desolation of Smaug he is shown to push back Azog with his staff, when he is ambushed by them.

Calling Gwaihir

When times grew desperate, Gandalf contacted Gwaihir, Lord of the Eagles, by means of a small, grey moth. Gandalf had saved the great Eagle from a poisoned arrow long ago, and as a result, Gwaihir was eager and ready to help out his own friend whenever he needed to. Gandalf called Gwaihir multiple times, in places ranging from Orthanc to the Black Gate of Mordor. Though not so much a magical ability as an extra lifeline, Gandalf knew exactly when he needed help and when he should call Gwaihir to get it.
It was Radagast the Brown who told the eagles that Gandalf had visited with Saruman in the books; in the movie, Gandalf is seen speaking with the moth.
In the Hobbit film adaption, Gandalf is seen talking to a red-orange butterfly instead of a grey moth to call Gwaihir.

Sword of Power

In the film adaptation of The Two Towers, while Gandalf was facing the Balrog, he charged his sword Glamdring with lightning. He then struck his foe and killed him. It is unknown whether Gandalf actually summoned the lightning or simply attracted it toward Glamdring, but either way, his sword had extra power, enough to slay the Balrog of Morgoth.

Call Shadowfax

Although not magical as such, Gandalf develops a friendship with the ""Lord of horses,"" Shadowfax in both the books and the films. After Gandalf takes Shadowfax from King Theoden's stables in Edoras, the horse develops a bond with Gandalf which meant that nobody else could ride or even touch Shadowfax, besides him. In the second film, Gandalf calls to Shadowfax by whistling just outside of Fangorn. Such is the bond between them that Gandalf rides Shadowfax without any harnesses and can direct him with his mind.

Counter-Spell

As seen in the first movie, Gandalf can counter any magical spell. As Gandalf the Grey, this ability is much weaker. When the Fellowship passes through the mountains, Saruman tries to bring it down. There Gandalf attempts to counter the spell, but fails.

Lightning Strike

This power is clearly described in the book The Hobbit in the Misty Mountains while escaping from an orc horde (obviously as Gandalf the Grey). He kills a few orcs and temporarily hides. The cartoon version of The Hobbit also boasts him using it during the Battle of Five Armies. In the Two Towers film adaptation, Gandalf slew the Balrog with lightning strikes repeatedly through Glamdring.

Blinding Light

Gandalf's second skill was Blinding Light, with which he would strike his foes blind with a blast of light resembling a magnified sunbeam. Though this particular attack did not deal much damage to foes in itself, it allowed any soldiers or cavalry to cut their enemies down with little to no resistance. Gandalf uses this spell once in the movies against the Fell Beasts of the Nazgûl so that Faramir's company could retreat to Minas Tirith safely. Gandalf did not use this Skill during the Battle of Helm's Deep, as is erroneously claimed, as the blinding light was caused by the rising Sun rising in the East (""On the morning of the fifth day, look to the East""). Blinding Light is quite possibly a much stronger version of Illumination.
In The Lord of the Rings: The Third Age (GBA) game, one of Gandalf's four skills is Blinding Light. All Evil Units on Gandalf's flank (except Fearless ones) would have a chance of going into morale failure depending on their morale, becoming useless the next turn. The higher the level of the spell, the more likely the morale failure. Some players choose Gandalf mainly because the morale failures would either play strategically into their hands or force the enemy heroes to join the fray, which would increase their chances of being killed and getting Good one-step closer to victory.
In The Hobbit trilogy, Gandalf uses this ability to blind the Goblins so the Dwarves can grab their weapons and fight for freedom, as well as well as blind Azog during his investigation in Dol Guldur.

Shield of the Istari

Gandalf can also conjure up a magical shield to protect himself from enemy attacks. It is shown in the movies only once, when Gandalf stands against the Balrog's flaming sword. However, on the extended version of The Return of the King, Gandalf uses the shield of Istari to protect himself from a spell cast by Saruman. In The Hobbit Trilogy he used it once again against Sauron while fleeing from Azog and his orc army. A different version is used by him that expands and dissapates to remove a spell of concealment in Dol Goldur as well.

Fire

Gandalf uses the power of fire in the Hobbit, to light pinecones in multi-colored fire and to throw them at wolves; he also uses fire in the Fellowship of the Ring to cast ablaze a bundle of wood, and a large cluster of trees to stay warm, and to combat more wolves. However, his ability with fire may be enhanced due to his possession of Narya (the Ring of Fire).

Destructive Blast

By far Gandalf's most devastating power is the destructive blast. Gandalf initiates this by raising his staff into the air and slamming it down on the ground. The weaker version of it is enough to break the Bridge of Khazad-dum, but at full power it can send surrounding legions flying into the air, instantly destroying them. In the Hobbit film, he used it to blasted away goblins and stun them long enough for the dwarves to rally themselves.
In the The Return of the King video game, the spell (from weak to full power) is known as Fog of War, Wrath of Anor, and Flame of Udun. This would imply that Gandalf could use Shadow powers as well as Light powers, though this is unconfirmed and at any case highly unlikely.
In The Lord of the Rings: The Battle for Middle-earth II, this spell is known as Word of Power. It can destroy all weak units (even upgraded ones), and significantly damage stronger ones.
In The Lord of the Rings: Aragorn's Quest (2010), Gandalf is an optional playable character.




 Trivia 
It is unclear whether Gandalf, being a Maia, did or did not participate in the War of Wrath in the First Age since he knew about Ancalagon the Black.
He is one of only three characters to appear in all six films of both The Hobbit and The Lord of the Rings trilogies, the other two being Galadriel and Sauron.
Wells the Grey is a homage to Gandalf from the TV Show The Flash.

Elgarain in the wilderness

Elgarain

Also Known As
Chief Ranger; called ""El"" by Dirhaborn


Race
Men


Lifespan
TA 2907 - TA 2933


Culture
Dúnedain of the North (Rangers of the North)


Weapon
Bow, sword, knives


Peter Jackson's films or other media

Actor
Kate Madison



In the fan-film Born of Hope, Elgarain was a Ranger of Arnor who served Arathorn II.

 Biography 
Born in the late Third Age, Elgarain's mother died in childbirth leaving her to grow up in a male influenced environment, which suited her fine. Dirhaborn was her closest friend; they grew up together and she often spied on him as he learned the ways of a ranger. Her father also taught her about plants and animals, and when her father was killed by Orcs while on a mission with Arathorn she requested to take his place and become a ranger, having often felt more at home in the forest than in village life. Arador was resistant to the idea, because although young women were taught basic woodlore and weapon training, they were usually not fighters. Feeling guilty about her father’s death, Arathorn supported her decision and requested that his father allow him to include her in his team. When Arador reluctantly agreed, he taught her the skills she'd need.
Elgarain was in love with Arathorn, but was devastated when he married Gilraen. Dirhaborn had been hiding his love for her, but finally revealed it when she planned to go far away to flee from her love for Arathorn. When a group of orcs came at them, he told her to run and warn the Dúnedain before the orcs killed him. Elgarain rushed back to Taurdal in time and warned everyone on the oncoming attack. During the ensuing battle, she defended Gilraen and Aragorn from being slaughtered, but was suddenly stabbed in the stomach by one of the orcs that came right up to her. As she lay dying, she apologized to Gilraen for her envy and told Arathorn that he and his son must live and not to lose hope. After that, she died in Arathorn's arms.
Elgarain was played by Kate Madison, the director and producer of Born of Hope, and is not from the books

 Biography 
For many years since the Nirnaeth Arnoediad, Arminas sought Turgon and the Kingdom of Gondolin but was unable to find it and had also been wandering with his companion Gelmir since the Nirnaeth Arnoediad. In recent years they had been living with Círdan at the Havens of Sirion, and were afterwards sent by him on an errand to Nargothrond bearing a warning from Ulmo, the Lord of Waters of the impending doom of the hidden realm. 
Before arriving there, they encountered Tuor at Gate of the Noldor as he was about to leave Hithlum. When they arrived in Nargothrond, he and Gelmir counseled Orodreth to shut the doors of his realm and remain a hidden folk. He was mistrusted by Túrin and the two argued over opposing views. Despite their warnings, Orodreth under the influence of Túrin did not listen to their advice. Arminas and Gelmir eventually departed south and reported what they were told to Círdan.[1][2][3]
His fate is unknown.

""The door won't give. It's too strong!""
—Murgash to Gothmog on the gate of Minas Tirith

Murgash was a high-ranking Black Uruk officer who served under the Witch-king of Angmar and Lieutenant Gothmog during the Siege of Gondor and subsequent Battle of the Pelennor Fields in March 3019. He and Guritz served as Gothmog's chief officers during the initial siege, with Murgash giving the order for their orc army to first move into Minas Tirith. All three of the leaders survived the charge of the Rohirrim, however both Guritz and Murgash were killed when Aragorn II Elessar, Legolas, Gimli and the deadly Army of the Dead arrived in the place of the Corsairs of Umbar and began slaughtering orcs.
He was a non-canonical character, invented for Peter Jackson's films. 

 Portrayal in adaptations 
 Peter Jackson's The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King 
When the orc army of Minas Morgul led by the Witch-king of Angmar and Lieutenant Gothmog arrived at Minas Tirith in Gondor in March 3019, Murgash, a Black Uruk of Mordor, accompanied Gothmog and Captain Guritz To the front lines of the army just outside Minas Tirith. He stood by his master's side as the heads of the Gondorian prisoners taken earlier at Osgiliath were catapulted into the city, apparently to ease the pain of those inside, before the initial siege began, during which Murgash led the orcs and uruks who attempted to use a battering ram to break down the gates to the city.
However, it soon became clear that with the strength of the gate and the problem of several soldiers of Gondor firing arrows at them, the gate could not be destroyed so easily. Murgash informed an enraged Gothmog of this, and the lieutenant promptly rectified the dilemma by having his men bring out the ""Wolf's Head"", the massive and immensely powerful wolf-like battering ram Grond. When the gates were subsequently brought down, Gothmog had Murgash give the order to move into the city, killing anyone seen inside.
Later, when the Rohirrim led by King Théoden of Rohan arrived, Murgash stood with Gothmog at the front of the gathered army preparing for the charge of the reinforcements. However, they soon realised that they were outnumbered, and Gothmog and Murgash backed away in fear as the horses reached the orcs and began trampling them. Murgash retreated and survived the onslaught as the orcs soon gained the upper hand again with the arrival of the Mûmakil and Haradrim to aide them.
Murgash later accompanied Guritz to the harlond to greet the late Corsairs of Umbar who were supposedly arriving to aid them, and yelled at the pirates for their being later. However, their sarcasm turned to terror when Aragorn II Elessar and his two companions, Legolas and Gimli, were revealed to be aboard the ships. Initially, the band of rocks assumed that they could easily be dealt with, but the Army of the Dead soon swarmed off the ships and charged the orcs head-on. Despite the obvious futility of even attempting to fight back, Murgash lunged at Aragorn with a sword, only to have his head sliced off.
Murgash was portrayed by Sala Baker.

Manwë (Quenya; IPA: [ˈmanʷe] - ""Blessed One"") was the leader of the Ainur, one of the Aratar, King of the Valar, husband of Varda, brother of the Dark Lord Melkor, and King of Arda. He was also known as Súlimo, Mânawenûz or Valahiru, and lived atop Mount Taniquetil in Valinor, the highest mountain of the world. The winds and airs were his servants.
He was the greatest in authority, but not in power, of all the Valar, Melkor being more powerful. He was however the greatest of the Aratar, among whom Melkor was not.

Contents[show]
 Biography 
    Depiction of his earliest form  
Manwë was (with Melkor) the eldest of the Ainur, and the one that best understood the will of Eru. When Melkor created the discord in the Music of the Ainur, the Second Theme of Eru that rose to counter the discord used Manwë as its chief instrument. When Arda was formed, Manwë was appointed Ruler of Arda, hence his most common title, the Elder King. Manwë was a kind, compassionate ruler, unconcerned with his own power. He oversaw all of the Valar's early attempts to order Arda, but was unable to stop Melkor's rampages until the Vala Tulkas came to Arda to assist his brethren.
Afterwards, the Valar under Manwë made an abode on Middle-earth in the Isle of Almaren and constructed the two Lamps of the Valar to provide light to the world. But Melkor destroyed the lamps, and the Valar retreated to the continent of Aman, which they heavily fortified. Eventually, the Elves awoke in Middle-earth, and Manwë at last went with the other Valar to subdue Melkor. They succeeded, and Melkor was imprisoned in the Halls of Mandos. He extended an invitation to the Elves to journey to Aman and live there amongst the Valar. For the three Ages of Melkor's imprisonment, the Valar and the Elves lived in peace and happiness. But eventually Melkor was allowed to plead for pardon before Manwë again.
As Manwë was completely free of evil, he was unable to comprehend it, leading him to believe Melkor's lies concerning his reformation. He released Melkor from Mandos, whereupon Melkor began plotting the downfall of the Elves and the ruin of Aman's bliss. He began to cleverly spread lies amongst the Ñoldor, who soon grew to resent the Valar because of said lies. Eventually, due to the rebellious actions of the Noldor prince Fëanor, Melkor's lies were uncovered, but he escaped before he could be recaptured. Soon thereafter, Melkor recruited the great spider Ungoliant and poisoned the Two Trees. He then murdered the King of the Noldor, Finwë, stole the Silmarils, and incited Fëanor's leaving Aman with most of the Noldor in rebellion.
Soon thereafter, Manwë learned that the rebellious Noldor had attacked and slaughtered many of the Teleri. As such, he forbade the Ñoldor from returning to Valinor once they left, and stated also that the Elves would receive no help from the Valar in their war against Morgoth. He then caused Valinor to be hidden by way of the Shadowy Seas and the Enchanted Isles to prevent the Ñoldor from returning.
To hearten the Eldar, he had Aulë fashion the Sun and the Moon, for he knew the rising of the Atani was coming soon, and sent Thorondor and the Eagles to watch them. After Morgoth's fall, Manwë cast him into the void. Manwë dresses in blue robes and has blue eyes. He wields a scepter of sapphire made for him by the Ñoldor. The Vanyar are his favorite Elves, and they live with him and Varda on Mount Taniquetil.

 Maiar of Manwë 
Eönwë, Manwë's banner-bearer and herald. In earlier conceptions of the legendarium, Eönwë, then called Fionwë Úrion, was envisioned as the son of Manwë and brother of Erinti, renamed as Ilmarë, Varda's handmaiden.
In some versions, Fionwë, later named Eönwë, is the one who will kill Morgoth for his love for Urwendi (Later named Arien).

Olórin (Gandalf), the second-in-command (and later leader) of the wizards sent to Middle-earth to fight against Sauron, and Manwë comforted him when Olórin showed uneasiness and fear of Sauron's powers.

 Etymology 
The name Manwë means ""blessed one"" or ""blessed person"", from the Quenya man (""blessed"") and wë (""person"").[3]
Súlimo literally means ""the Breather"", from the Quenya súlimë (""wind"")[4] and Sindarin sûl (""wind"").[5]
His Sindarin name was Aran Einior, the ""Elder King"".[6]

 Titles 
Elder King
King of Arda
Lord of the Breath of Arda
King of the Valar
Lord of the West

 Trivia 
 Manwë shares many characteristics with Zeus and Odin, the supreme gods of Greek and Norse Mythology.

Caladhir was a Silvan elf from Lothlórien.

 Biography 
Sometime during the War of the Ring, he was one of Haldir's elf-host that arrived to Helm's Deep in aiding the Rohirrim and their king against Saruman's army in 3019. He was stationed on the Deeping Wall and fought long and hard against the Uruk-hai infantry, who ended up losing. When Theoden called for everyone to ""Pull Back to the Keep"", Caladhir was among the elves that did so. Before retreating to the keep, he picked up Gimli, who was fighting very hard against the Uruk-hai, and dragged him back to the keep with the help of Legolas. Caladhir may have survived the battle. If so, it is possible that he went to the Undying Lands in the West or stayed in Middle-earth during the early years of the Fourth Age. His fate is not known.[1]

 Notes 
Caladhir appears in the film The Two Towers as a non-canonical character.
He does not appear in any of the books.
Caladir's skin tone appeared to be brown, which is rare for elves. He may have been descended from men.

Culture
Númenórean (House of Elros)



Hallacar was a Númenórean nobleman; the son of Hallatan of Hyarastorni and husband of Tar-Ancalimë, the first Ruling Queen of Númenor.

 Biography 
Hallacar was a descendant of the short reigning king Vardamir Nólimon. He was a royal suitor who wished to marry Ancalimë, but she rejected all those who sought her hand and went into hiding in the land of Emerië.[2] He knew that Ancalimë was there and for a time he lived there as a simple shepherd, going by the name of Mámandil. The two became very close friends and frequently met with each other in the pastures. There he sang songs to her for he was quite skilled in such things and she was pleased, but he altered his songs to lament the lovers of old in an attempt to express his love for her. Afterwards, he did declare his love for her but she did not return it and drew back. It was after this that he revealed what his true name was and his lineage. Angry at this deception, she rejected him, at least at first but eventually they did agree to wed despite the fact that she did not desire to be married.
They married in SA 1000. Their marriage seemed to be for political reasons as Ancalimë needed to produce an heir to continue the royal bloodline and to prevent her cousin Soronto, who also had a claim to the throne of Númenor from becoming king. Hallacar's life with the Queen was not a happy one but they did have a son Anárion, the future Tar-Anárion. Afterwards the two became estranged and begun living apart from each other.[1]

Dirhaborn was a young Dúnedain who lived in the realm of Eriador.

 Portrayal in adaptations 
 Born of Hope 
Born in TA 2905 of the Late Third Age, Dirhaborn was a quick and talented bowman, and a great Ranger of the North. While growing up in the village of Taurdal, Dirhaborn became a good friend and companion of Elgarain. Although to her, Dirhaborn was like a brother, he was secretly in love with her, sometimes spying her in his classes. When Elgarain was planning to leave Taurdal, as she was grieving and jealous that Arathorn married Gilraen, Dirhaborn followed her and confessed his love. The two made plans to leave together, but before they could do so, a group of Orcs appeared out of the forest.  Thus, they instead needed to warn the villagers of an incoming attack. Dirhaborn fought bravely for his life until he was slain by orcs.  His sacrifice gave Elgarain enough time to warn Arathorn and the villagers on what was coming.
His head was thrown towards Arathorn when the orcs attacked Taurdal.
This character is portrayed by Danny George in the film Born of Hope, and is not from the books.

Around FO 220, Herumor led a secret cult which worshiped Melkor, Sauron and Saruman. He fought against Eldarion and the Reunited Kingdom.[1]

 Etymology 
The name Herumor translates into ""Dark Lord"" from heru (""lord"") and mor (""dark"").[2]

 Behind the Scenes 
These events were told in the unfinished tale known as ""The New Shadow"", Tolkien wrote about thirteen pages of this story but there was no evil power left, for all of Melkor's power was extinguished in the First Age and all of Sauron's in the Third Age. It is not known what race he was. He could have been a Man but that was never established, as the story was never finished.[1]

Robin Smallburrow, nicknamed Cock Robin, was a longer-standing Shirriffs within the Shire at the time of the end of the Third Age and during Sharkey's attacks on the Shire.

 Biography 
Robin became Shirriff in TA 3012. Though having joined the Shirriffs earlier than Sharkey's occupation, when questioned by Samwise Gamgee on his role Robin replies that he only applied for the post of Shirriff as a means of wandering the Shire, talking with folks and ""knowing where the good beer was."" Like many Shirriffs during Sharkey's scouring of the Shire, Robin Smallburrow is forced to continue service against his will as a part of the Shirriff's First Eastfarthing Troop in the town of Frogmorton. However, during the Hobbit's uprising against their foreign oppressors, it is assumed that Smallburrow defects in order to help the hobbits.
After Sharkey's demise and the effort and work to return to norm within the Shire, very little is recorded of Smallburrow and his role or family within the Shire, though it is assumed that he, like the hobbits who lived at the start of the Fourth Age, enjoyed the years of plenty and prosperity that dawned over the Shire.
It also appears that he was good friends with Samwise Gamgee, as Sam named his twelfth child, Robin Gamgee, after him.[1]

Edain (House of Hador)



Dírhavel was a minstrel of the Edain during the later First Age, and was only known for one composed lay in all his life, but it became the greatest and the most remembered of all the lays made by Men.

Contents[show]
Biography
Dírhavel was of the House of Hador[1], and had probably fled from Dor-lómin when he came to the Havens of Sirion. Because of his ancestry, he was very interested in the deeds of his house and searched for information among all the refugees, thus he met Mablung of Doriath who told him many things about Túrin Turambar. By luck he also met an old man called Andvir whose father, Androg, had been a member of Turin's outlaw-band.
He used the information he had gathered and wrote in Sindarin a very long, in fact the longest of all from that time, lay in the verse-mode called Minlamad thent/estent. This mode was spoken verse, not unlike the Old English alliterative mode. The Narn i Chîn Húrin tells of the fates of Húrin's children Túrin and Nienor Níniel, with emphasis on Túrin. It is a very tragic story, but the lay was highly praised by the Elves and remembered by them. It is the only full account on Túrin's life, and all later writings on the subject fall back on this one.
Dírhavel was later killed when the Sons of Fëanor attacked the Havens of Sirion in the third and last Kinslaying.[2]

Etymology
The meaning of the name Dírhavel is unknown. It is difficult to decipher any possible origin of the name, but it may have come from the Sindarin words dîr, meaning ""man"" (although can be translated as ""hard""), hav, meaning ""sit"", or possibly haust, meaning ""rest"", and el, which means ""star"". If this were to be the case, his name could mean ""man of the resting star"", though it is unlikely to be.[3]

Ragnir was an Edain Man of the House of Hador. 

 Biography 
Ragnir was a blind servant in the household of Húrin Thalion and Morwen Eledhwen at the time just after the Nirnaeth Arnoediad. As Morwen was about to arrange for her son Túrin to go to Doriath, he was worried that his mother would be left with only Ragnir and a few old women to tend the house.
Ragnir no doubt eventually died there in service to their house.[1][2]
It is not known how Ragnir had become blinded but it is possible that it was due to old age.

Balcmeg was one of the Orcs killed in the Fall of Gondolin by Tuor, according to The Book of Lost Tales. 
Tolkien wrote the story of the fall of the city in 1917 and never fully revised it, and Balcmeg does not appear in the published Silmarillion, although he was obviously of some importance, for only three orcs out of many that Tuor slew in Gondolin were named.[1]

 Etymology 
Balcmeg was a Sindarin word that meant ""Heart of Evil"".

","Boldog was an Orc-captain of the host of Angband during the First Age, who is only told of in the original Lay of Leithian, and does not appear in the stories of The Silmarillion.

 Biography 
""Boldog he sent, but Boldog was slain: Strange ye were not in Boldog's train.""
—From a passage in the ""Lays of Beleriand""

As it is told in The Lays of Beleriand, Boldog was a formidable leader of Orcs, commanded by Morgoth to lead them on a great raid upon the realm of Doriath and to capture Lúthien, daughter of King Thingol and Queen Melian the Maia. Boldog drove his host south over the highlands of Dorthonion and the through enchanted forest of Taur-nu-Fuin following the Orcs' Road of Haste into the Pass of Anach. Where fell darkness met the mists of the magic, which were the Girdle of Melian, just east of the river Mindeb, the Orc-host reached the border of Doriath. To meet the deadly threat posed by Boldog's invasion in force, Thingol musters his full might with his two great Captains, Beleg and Mablung. He leads the army of Sindarin Elves beyond the North March of Doriath. Thingol and Boldog meet in single combat in the midst of the battle. Thingol wielded his Dwarf-forged sword, Aranrúth, Boldog fought with an iron spear of some note that was later used by Mablung in the Hunting of the Wolf. Thingol slays Boldog, the Orc-host is utterly defeated and the remnants destroyed by being driven into Taur-nu-Fuin.

    Boldog fights Thingol  
The Battle of the Northmarch was the culminating battle of a series of attacks in Morgoth's campaign against Doriath, following his victories in the Dagor Bragollach (Battle of Sudden Flame), the fourth of the great Battles of Beleriand that broke the Siege of Angband.

 Canon 
Details of Boldog's raid are scattered through numerous versions of texts within The Lays of Beleriand, compiled by Christopher Tolkien - however, no aspect of the plot-lines involving Boldog are in serious contradiction with the ""final"" canon of Quenta Silmarillion. Boldog's independent command of a host of orcs with its formidable objectives indicates that he would have been several ranks above most other Orc-Captains and champions (such as Orcobal or Balcmeg, who both were from a different century), and it is thought elsewhere in the sources that Boldog was of some lesser order of the Maiar corrupted by Morgoth that took the form of an Orc, as opposed to previously being an Elf that became mutilated (which was the ancient origin of Orcs in general).

Tauriel was a Wood-elf of Mirkwood, and captain of the Elven guard of Thranduil's Woodland Realm.
Tauriel is non-canonical, as she does not appear in the works of J.R.R. Tolkien, and is only in The Hobbit film trilogy.

 The Hobbit film trilogy 
 The Desolation of Smaug 
""I do not think that you would allow your son to pledge himself to a lowly Silvan Elf.""
—{{{2}}}

Tauriel first appears in The Hobbit: The Desolation of Smaug as a captain of the Mirkwood Elven Guard. Throughout the film, a subplot develops involving romance between her and Kíli. She rescues Kíli after the Dwarves are ambushed by Giant Spiders as she leads a series of missions to clear Mirkwood of their growing presence. Under Legolas's orders, she and the other guards take the Dwarves back to the Elven cavern fortress and confiscate their weapons. There, Tauriel becomes curious of Kíli's talisman and they talk for a while. Legolas watches them talking from a distance.

    Tauriel confronted by the Elf-king Thranduil  
Later, Thranduil confronts Tauriel, telling her that, as a captain of the guard, she must drive the Giant Spiders out of Mirkwood. She explains that new spiders continually enter the kingdom after the previous ones were wiped out. She suggests sorties to destroy the spiders' source outside the kingdom's boundaries near Dol Guldur, but this idea is quickly dismissed by Thranduil. When she asks what will happen to other lands after the spiders are driven from Mirkwood, Thranduil says that the other lands are not his concern. He mentions then that Legolas, his son, has grown fond of her but that she should not give him hope where there is none, because Thranduil would not allow his son to pledge to her being she is a ""lowly"" Silvan elf.
When the Dwarves escape, Tauriel and Legolas lead a band of Elf-guards in battle as Bolg and his troops arrive to attack the Dwarves. During the battle, Kíli is injured and is saved once again by Tauriel. She and Legolas take Narzug, an Orc soldier to the palace for interrogation. Narzug mocks Tauriel about the impending death of Kíli from a Morgul arrow, which enrages her. When she tries to kill the Orc, Thranduil orders her to leave him be. She then leaves the palace without the permission of the Elf-king to search for the Dwarves. Legolas confronts her and asks her to come back with him so that Thranduil may forgive her. But Tauriel insists that the fight also involves them, and argues that the king's isolationist policies blind them from larger issues affecting the entire world, and that since Kíli will die from the poisoned arrow if he is not helped, she must find him and tend to the wound. As a result of his growing affections for her, Legolas agrees to accompany her.
In Lake-town, the house of Bard is attacked by Bolg and his troops. Tauriel and Legolas arrive to rescue the Dwarves and kill the Orcs. As Legolas runs after Bolg, Tauriel takes some athelas obtained by Bofur and uses it to heal Kili's wounds, while chanting in Sindarin. Half in delirium, Kíli speaks of her beauty and wonders aloud whether she might someday love him. Tauriel tells him to lie still but is obviously affected, and Kíli moves his hand to hold hers.

    Tauriel mourns Kíli's death  
 The Battle of the Five Armies 
""If this is love then I do not want it. Why does it hurt so much?""
—Tauriel

Tauriel admits her love for Kili in The Hobbit: The Battle of the Five Armies, although in The Hobbit: The Desolation of Smaug she denies it.
Tauriel leaves Thranduil and accompanies Legolas and Bilbo to Ravenhill in order to warn Thorin, Dwalin, Fili, and Kíli of an upcoming attack led by Bolg. She successfully finds Kíli and the two battle against Bolg together. She is overpowered and almost killed by Bolg, but Kíli sacrifices himself to save her. Tauriel mourns over Kíli's body and kisses his lips, thus showing her fondness for him.

 Tauriel's fate 
Tauriel was banished from Mirkwood by Thranduil, so what happens to Tauriel after the Battle of the Five Armies remains unknown, although actress Evangeline Lilly has stated in an interview that Tauriel returns to Mirkwood[1].

 Video games 
Tauriel appears in The Hobbit: Armies of the Third Age as a hero in the Elven faction.
Tauriel is a playable character in LEGO The Hobbit: The Video Game.

 Behind the scenes 
Even though Evangeline Lilly, who portrays Tauriel in the trilogy, expressed some trepidation at the reaction of Tolkien purists to a character that does not appear in Tolkien's written works, she stated that for her, creating the character for the adaptation was justified: ""I believe she is authentic, because Tolkien refers to The Woodland Elves, he just doesn't talk about who they are specifically… [Peter and Fran] know that world so well. They’re not going to create a character that is not true to Tolkien's world.""[2]
She also stated that she signed on under a stipulation: “For the record, when I took this job, in 2011, I made one stipulation. That’s it. I just said… I swear to God, I said, ‘I will not do this film if you will not guarantee me one thing. You have to guarantee me there will be no love triangle.’ And there wasn’t. For the whole time I shot. For a year of shooting there was no love triangle, And then, I came back for reshoots in 2012 and they were like, ‘Well, we made a couple of alterations to some scenes and we added a couple more scenes,’” the actress continued. “And all of a sudden manifested a love triangle before my very eyes and the film was shot and I’m in and there’s no getting out and there was no escaping it.” 

 Controversy 
Many Tolkien fans, and even average moviegoers, have expressed dissatisfaction with the character on social media, stating that including a character that didn't exist in Tolkien's work so heavily into the movie is a disrespect to Tolkien, and is just an attempt to appeal more to female audiences, and to those who have complained the small amount of female characters in the book and the Lord of the Rings films.[3] Tauriel's love-triangle with Kili and Legolas has been described as ""forced,"" ""cliche,"" and ""unconvincing.""

 Character 
A captain of Thranduil's Elven Guards, Tauriel is a professional in the military and leads the Woodland Realm's armed forces. Her parents were killed by orcs when she was younger and it is hinted that Thranduil looked after her since then. She is a young elf, around the age of 600 (however in some documentaries Peter Jackson said she would be around 1000, in fact giving a specific age of 1,347), and is insightful into the changing nature of Middle-earth. In contrast to Thranduil's portrayed isolationism, Tauriel is interventionist and recognizes the growing evils of the world and the need to eradicate them.
Moderately effective in infantry combat, she is proficient in both archery and hand-to-hand combat. Her primary weapons are a reflex bow and two long daggers. She is shown to be an adept archer and marksman, with elvish reflexes and accuracy. She can simultaneously wield her bow and knife in combat, and can fire an arrow quick enough to intervene with the passage of a slower Orc arrow. She is also shown to possess some medical knowledge, being able to treat wounds from poisoned weapons. As a native of the Woodland Realm, she is also a capable tree climber.

 Etymology 
Tauriel means ""Forest maiden,"" from the Sindarin words taur (""wood, forest"") and the feminine suffix -iel (""daughter, maiden"").[4]

 Trivia 
 Despite the establishment in the film that Tauriel is meant to be around 600-years-old, there are disagreements with her age. Her actress, Evangeline Lily, stated in an interview that Tauriel was 600 years old, Legolas was 1,900, and King Thranduil was 3,000[5]. However, as mentioned above, Peter Jackson stated that Tauriel is meant to be around 1,347-years-old; but in the same interview where she mentioned that Tauriel was 600 and Legolas was 1,900, Evangeline Lily states that Tauriel and Legolas have known each other since they were both children and grew up together[6]. However, the official movie guide for The Lord of the Rings, states that Legolas’ birth occurred during TA 87. This would make him 2,931-years-old by the time that the War of the Ring occurs, and 2,871-years-old during the events of The Hobbit. This means that Tauriel herself would have to be around 2,800-years-old herself for her to have known Legolas when he was a child. In short, there is possibly no actual canonical age that all of the filmmakers have agreed upon, meaning that Tauriel's age open to discussion and personal interpretation.

Edain (House of Haleth), Men of Brethil



Hardang was a Man, and a Chieftain of the Men of Brethil during the First Age.

 Biography 
Hardang was a descendant of Halmir of the House of Haleth. His father was Hundad, and his grandfather was Hundar. After the death of the Chieftain of Brethil, Handir, Hardang tried to supersede his cousin, Brandir, in acquiring the throne of the Men of Brethil. Many citizens believed Brandir to be unfit to rule them, and therefore supported Hardang.
Many people also wanted Brandir's cousin Manthor to assume the role of Chieftain instead, though. Unfortunately for him and his supporters, he was related to Brandir by a daughter, which meant that his kinship with Brandir was worth less in the eyes of the people. Hardang then won the vote, and became the Chieftain of the Men of Brethil in FA 499. Upon becoming Chieftain, Hardang hired Manthor to be the Captain of the Guards at the Crossings of Taeglin.
Within two years of ruling Brethil, whispers of the return of Húrin began echoing throughout Brethil. Hardang harbored resentment for the House of Hador, of which Húrin was a member, as it was not his own, and many of the houses of the time had harsh rivalries. Therefore, upon Húrin's actual return, Hardang launched an attack against him. Húrin wounded Hardang in the battle, and Manthor later defended Húrin and restored his honor, which made Hardang's approval with the people suffer.
Húrin survived the conflict, and Hardang lost a great deal more public approval for the attempt on his life. A group of the citizens then banded together and burned the Hall of the Chieftains, from where all the Chieftains had ruled, with the intent of killing Hardang. He tried fleeing from the burning structure, but was hit in the back by a spear while running away, and perished.[2]

 Notes 
In early versions of the story, Hardang's name was Harathor, and it was he, not Manthor, who was the brother of Túrin's companion Hunthor.

 Biography 
Haldir was the son Halmir of Brethil.[1] He became Chieftain of the Haladin in Brethil for a time in his adulthood. He married Glóredhel of the House of Hador at the same feast where Galdor married Hareth[2], and they had a son named Handir. He fostered Húrin and Huor in their childhood years.[3] Haldir marched with the rest of his kin in support of the Union of Maedhros and was slain in the Nírnaeth Arnoediad along with most of the Men of Brethil.[4] Afterwards, his son Handir then inherited the title of Chieftain of the Haladin. When Glóredhel learned of his death, she fell into grief and illness and soon died.[5]

Manthor was a Man of Brethil during the First Age. He was descended from Halmir, who was the fourth chieftain of the Haladin and the great-grandfather of Manthor through his mother Meleth.[1]

Contents[show]
 Biography 
Manthor was the son of Agathor and Meleth. He ran for Chieftain of the Men of Brethil against Hardang, because Manthor was related to Brandir the Lame, the previous chieftain of the Haladin, and Manthor thought that he could win by his noble blood being that Brandir was his second-cousin. However, Manthor was related to Brandir through Halmir's daughter Hiril, who was the grandmother of Manthor and the sister of Halmir's son Haldir, who in turn was the grandfather of Brandir. This meant that Manthor's kinship with Brandir was worth less in the eyes of the people of Haleth, and he lost the election. And Hardang too was related to Brandir, being that Brandir also was his second-cousin through Halmir's other son Hundar, the brother of Haldir and the grandfather of Hardang. Hence, Hardang was the victor in the election, and he appointed Manthor to be the Captain of the Guard at the Crossings of Taeglin. Sagroth, Avranc, and Forhend were some who were under his authority.
At Haudh-en-Elleth, he and his company once came across weary Húrin, and brought him to the Hall of the Haladin, fulfilling Húrin's errand. At the Hall, the chieftan Hardang tried to attack Manthor as they were of opposing houses. Húrin managed to wound Hardang in his household, and after an imprisonment was forced to stand trial for it, at the 301st Folkmoot of Judgment. Manthor successfully defended Húrin there, and revealed Hardang's corrupted loyalty to the people, which led to a revolt.

 Death 
Manthor died in woods next to Nen Girith, by an arrow-wound from Avranc, who earlier had turned against him and broken his command. This took place after the revolt at the trial, during which Avranc had tried three times to slay Manthor with an arrow.

""Long has he [Lord Denethor] foreseen this doom!""
—Iorlas, at the Citadel of Minas Tirith

Irolas was a Man of Gondor and an officer of Minas Tirith during the last days of the Third Age. 
He is non-canonical, as he does not appear in the works of J.R.R. Tolkien, and only in Peter Jackson's The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King. 

 Biography 
He appears on the high level (the Citadel) of Minas Tirith when the wounded body of Faramir is brought in with Gandalf, after Faramir's and his cavalry's attempt to retake Osgiliath again from the Orcs. 

 Behind the scenes 
His character was originally meant to portray Beregond, but his role was so small that Peter Jackson decided it was not worth it to keep that name. He is often seen as Imrahil.
A Minas Tirith guard called ""Iorlas"" also appears in the film. In the subtitles, when a presumably dead Faramir is being brought into Minas Tirith by his horse, it says: Iorlas: Open the gate quick!
This occurrence is correct. But earlier on in the film, when Irolas is making an announcement, it says: Iorlas: It is as the lord Denethor predicted! Long has he foreseen this doom! This is incorrect, as Irolas says this. Also, he is confused with the character Imrahil.

Brego was a horse of Rohan, who appears in Peter Jackson's film adaptations of The Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers and The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King. He does not appear in any of the books, though he appears to take his name from the former king of Rohan named in the books.

 Portrayal 
    Uraeus and Viggo Mortensen on set  
Brego was a bay horse with a white star on his forehead and white markings on his hind legs. He was the steed of King Théoden's son, Théodred, who was mortally wounded in battle with Orcs. It is assumed that Brego was brought back to Rohan by those riding with Éomer when he went to rescue his cousin.
After that rider's death, Brego became wild and refused to accept any new rider, until Aragorn met him in the stables of Edoras. Aragorn calmed the horse, speaking to him in Sindarin, then told the stable hands to turn him free, saying ”This fellow has seen enough of war.""
On the way from Edoras to Helm's Deep, Aragorn was unhorsed and presumed killed in a battle with Warg riders; however, he fell into the river and floated downstream. Brego found him on the shore of the river and nudged him awake, carrying him to Helm's Deep in time to bring warning of Saruman's approaching army of Uruk-hai.
Brego was ridden by Aragorn to the Paths of the Dead, though he refused to go any further when drawing closer to the door. The two of them were later reunited at Minas Tirith, and Aragorn rode to the Morannon to confront Sauron's forces. Brego's fate is unknown.

 Trivia 
 According to the cast commentary on the extended version of The Two Towers, Brego was played by a horse named Uraeus; Viggo Mortensen liked the horse so much that he purchased him after production wrapped. in 2015 Viggo Mortensen made the following the announcement on his website: 'Aged 28, but a timeless presence in the minds of those who had the honour of knowing this proud, handsome, and supremely intelligent being, mighty Uraeus has finally come to rest on the physical plane. Thank you, Jane and Ray, for helping him do so with dignity. Dearest friend and teacher, I hold you and keep you.'

During a celebration of Ulbar's return, Aldarion came to the house desiring rest during which time he spoke to Ulbar's son Îbal about seafaring and gave a red jewel on a band of gold to his wife, as a reward for Ulbar's six years of service to him.
Ulbar greatly respected Aldarion calling him the ""The Great Captain"".[1]

Culture

Weapon

Peter Jackson's films or other media

Actor
Gareth Brough



Goblok was an Half-troll[2] chieftain and main antagonist in the fan film The Hunt for Gollum. He leads a band of orcs who have been sent by Sauron to capture Gollum.  

Contents[show]
 Portrayal in adaptations 
 The Hunt for Gollum 
In the fan-film, Goblok is an Orc-Troll hybrid chieftain and leader of a band of Orcs from Mordor, even though he is referred to be from the ''mines''. He has received orders from his master Sauron to find the creature known as Gollum and capture him alive. Goblok sends two orc scouts to search for him, but the two are slain by the Ranger Aragorn. After that, during the night, Goblok orders his soldiers to find Gollum and bring him back. The orc band manages to follow Aragorn into the forests near Mirkwood and attacks him, but they are quickly proven to be no match for him. Goblok soon confronts him himself, but the Ranger manages to stab him in the throat, killing him.

 Weapons and Armor 
Goblok is armed with an axe and club which he uses while fighting Aragorn. He could possibly also have a crude Orc-fashioned sword as well. Goblok's armor seems to be made out of bone and metal and some type of pelt, possibly Warg-skin.

 Trivia 
The part is played and voiced by Gareth Brough. On the website, Goblok is said to be a Half-troll.
He is apparently not from Mordor but from the ""mines"", possibly meaning Moria. In the strategy game Battle for Middle-Earth II half-trolls are allied with the goblins living there.
His name means ""stupid"" in Indonesian.

Shire-hobbits (Gardner family)



Hamfast Gardner was a Hobbit of the Shire.

Contents[show]
 Biography 
Hamfast was the seventh child and fourth son of Samwise Gamgee and Rosie Cotton. He had six younger siblings Daisy, Primrose, Bilbo, Ruby, Robin, and Tolman. Hamfast's namesake was his paternal grandfather, Hamfast Gamgee I, who around the Shire was known as the ""Gaffer"". He was the first child of Sam's not to be foreseen by Frodo.[1]

 Etymology 
Hamfast was named after Sam's father, Hamfast Gamgee.
He may also have been called Hamfast Gardner after his father, who became known as Sam Gardner because of his skill at gardening and his role in replanting the Shire after the War of the Ring.[citation needed]","Primrose Gardner was a Hobbit of the Shire.

 Biography 
Primrose Gardner born in FO 14 (SR 1435) and was the ninth child and fifth daughter of Samwise Gamgee and his beloved wife Rosie Cotton. She had four younger siblings. She was the second child of Sam's not to have a namesake (her sister Elanor being the first), but they perhaps could've gotten the name from her mother Rose. This might've been confusing around the household with both a mother and a sister named Rose, which could be easily mistaken for Primrose.[1]

 Etymology 
Primrose is the name of a flower native to western and southern Europe. Naming her 'Primrose' was no doubt keeping with the tradition of hobbits to name the females of their race after that of flowers.

 Biography 
Legolas Greenleaf was a member of the House of the Tree and was one of Galdor's scouts. He escaped the Fall of Gondolin with its survivors and led them across the Cristhorn.[1] After the First Age he moved to Tol Eressëa where he remained ever after, going by the name Laiqalassë.[2]

 Etymology 
The Legolas of Gondolin, whom Tolkien would have likely renamed, has a different etymology. His name Laiqalassë is the Quenyan rendering of the name, from the primitive Quenya words laica (""green"") and lassë (""leaf"").[3] The Sindarin Legolas translates to ""Green-leaf"" and also ""Keen-sight"" from leg (""keen, piercing"") and last (""look, glance"").[2]

 Other versions of the legendarium 
A character of the same name, Legolas of the Fellowship, shares the same name meaning and has superior sight in the dark.

Seeing all the death falling upon her family, Morwen decided to send her children away. She set them on a horse and sent them to safety. She is seen later in Helm's Deep where she is reunited with her children. It is likely that Morwen's son fought and died in the Battle of Helm's Deep, as not many Rohirrim survived the end of the battle and she is seen hugging Éowyn desperately.[2]

""No world shall be beyond my rule; no enemy shall be beyond my wrath.""
—Alfrid Lickspittle to Gandalf the Grey in The Hobbit: The Battle of the Five Armies

Alfrid Lickspittle was the Master's Deputy of Lake-town in TA 2941. Later, he was relieved of that title during The Hobbit: The Battle of the Five Armies.
Although a counselor is mentioned in the book, he is not named, so Alfrid is considered non-canonical.

    LEGO Alfrid  
Contents[show]
 Portrayal in adaptations 
 The Hobbit film trilogy 
Alfrid is only a character in The Hobbit film series. The character was referred to in the novel The Hobbit at the end of Chapter 10 as one of the Master's counselors, but not by name. He is played by actor Ryan Gage in the second and third films. He advises the Master in matters of diplomacy, trade, and the defense of Lake-town.

 The Desolation of Smaug 
In The Hobbit: The Desolation of Smaug, Alfrid stopped Bard the Bowman from entering Lake-town with barrels filled with fish (which was to hide Thorin and Company in order to smuggle them into the town) as he was not allowed to fill the barrels, and ordered Braga and the guards to empty them into the lake. Bard then reminded Alfrid that food was scarce and threatened him with unrest among the citizenry if they heard that the Master was dumping fish in the lake, causing Alfrid to order the guards to stop and allow him to pass. He then threatened Bard that the Master was watching him and knew where he lived, but Bard replied that it was a small town, so everyone knew where everyone lived.
Later on, Alfrid warns the Master about Bard's rebellious attitude against him, and is ordered to send spies to watch his house. He was later present when the Dwarves were caught stealing weapons and then persuaded the Master that the town would have a share of the treasure if they took back the Lonely Mountain from the dragon Smaug. The Master reluctantly agrees, in order to have his greedy hands on the share, and Alfrid felt the same way. Later, when Bard told his son Bain to hide the Black Arrow to use it later when the dragon arrives, Alfrid helps the guards by tripping Bard, and with the assistance of the Master knocking him unconscious with a wooden plank, they then lock him away in the prison.

 The Battle of the Five Armies 
In The Hobbit: The Battle of the Five Armies, as Smaug starts attacking the town, Alfrid, the Master and some of the Master's guards attempt to flee the city by a small boat which they fill with as much gold as they can without bothering to help any of the other citizens of Lake-town. As they are just setting off Alfrid realizes that they have too much gold on the boat and he advises the Master to drop something off it. The Master agrees, but to avoid dumping his riches he pushes Alfrid off instead. This was actually fortunate for Alfrid since shortly after he is pushed off, Smaug is killed and he lands on the boat, crushing the Master and his guards and killing them instantly.
The next morning Alfrid swims to the shore screaming and pleading for help, but in annoyance at being given none, he tells everyone that in the absence of the Master he is the one in charge of Lake-town. The people then attack him and try to lynch him but Bard stops them, saying that there has been enough blood spilled already and that there will be no need for more. During their journey to the mountain Alfrid reluctantly does whatever Bard tells him to do but he continues to be cruel to the other people of Lake-town and lazy in any task given to him. When the group first reaches the mountain the people camp out in the ruins of Dale. Gandalf then shows up; Alfrid is rude to him and tells him to leave (mistaking him for a vagabond), but Bard lets him in. During the night Bard puts Alfrid on watch duty; of course he falls asleep and fails to do his job when an army of Wood-elves arrives at the mountain. Later when Bilbo Baggins gives Bard and Thranduil the Arkenstone, Gandalf tells Alfrid to take Bilbo to his room and make sure he doesn't sneak away, but unfortunately the next morning when Alfrid comes in with Bilbo's breakfast he finds that he had escaped.
During the battle, Alfrid insists to Bard that he should escort the elderly, the wounded and the women and the children to safety, in an act of cowardice since he didn't want to fight. Bard agrees about taking the helpless to shelter but insists Alfrid fight, and gives him a sword. Annoyed, Alfrid dresses up like an elderly woman and stays in the main hall with them. Later towards the end of the battle, the women decide to help the men in battle, but Alfrid, still dressed as an old lady, refuses. When Alfrid's hood flies off and they all see who he really is, the people of Lake-town are furious at Alfrid and call him a coward; he then sees a large pot full of money and decides to make a run for it, so he grabs the pot and runs away. He is confronted by a Ogre who knocks him over causing the pot to smash, but just as the ogre was about to kill him, Bard kills it, saving Alfrid's life.

 Death (Extended Edition only) 
Showing no sign of gratitude toward Bard, Alfrid regathers the money he dropped and runs away. He later hides in a catapult attached to a dead Troll, watching as Gandalf confronts another Troll, unsuccessfully trying to use his staff's power. However, one of Alfrid's coins slips off his corset and falls on the catapult lever. The coin triggers the weapon, throwing Alfrid straight into the troll's mouth. Alfrid and the troll asphyxiate each other, inadvertently saving Gandalf.

 Character 
At heart, Alfrid is described to be a power-hungry, egomaniacal, narcissistic and opportunistic sycophant, and his counsel could not always be relied upon to serve anyone other than himself. He will cling to anything that will benefit him and provide him with power over others. He has an extremely arrogant habit of demanding respect which he hasn't even come close to earning. Alfrid is instinctively hypocritical and self-serving, shown by the fact that to start with he was abusive, vindictive and antagonistic toward Bard, but after Smaug's death and Bard being seen as a hero, Alfrid grovelled at his feet and bragged, incorrectly, that he had always admired Bard and viewed him as a great man. He is extremely disliked by the townspeople because he is so cruel and snobby towards them, and when Lake-town is destroyed they do not hesitate to try and turn their anger on him.

Fimbul was one of Azog's Orc hunters in The Hobbit and the lieutenant of the vile Yazneg, who led the Orc hunters after Thorin Oakenshield and his band of Dwarves. Fimbul later becomes Azog's right hand and second-in-command after Yazneg is fed to the Wargs by Azog for his failures. The character of Fimbul is not in the writings of J.R.R. Tolkien; he was created for Peter Jackson's The Hobbit film trilogy.

 The Hobbit film trilogy 
    Fimbul, while chasing the Dwarves along with Azog and the Hunter Orcs  
In TA 2941, Fimbul along with Yazneg were hired by Azog the Defiler to hunt down Thorin Oakenshield and his company of Dwarves during the Quest of Erebor. When they found the Company at the Lone Lands camping out, Yazneg ordered him to send word to their master that they have found his enemy's location. Fimbul later accompanied Yazneg, numerous other Gundabad Orcs and Wargs on an attack on Thorin's group and were led astray by Radagast the Brown who was using his rabbit pulled sled to act as a distraction for the Dwarves. However, when the Orc caught the Company's scent and was killed, both Fimbul and Yazneg were able to detect the Dwarves hiding in a small crevice and proceeded to attack until Elrond and his Elven warriors arrived and slayed many of the party and caused the two surviving Orcs to flee for their lives.
At Weathertop, where the other Gundabad Hunter Orcs had made their base, Fimbul and Yazneg arrived and had to report the Dwarves' escape, to their commander, Azog. Fimbul then watched in horror as Azog threw Yazneg to the wargs for his failures. After Yazneg's death, Fimbul succeeded him as Azog's right hand and the second-in-command of the party and rode by his commander's side as he leaded the hunt for Thorin and his company.
The Orcs eventually catch up to the Dwarves after the latter's narrow escape from the Goblin Town and force the Dwarves to climb the surrounding trees to escape the vicious Wargs. Soon after Thorin is critically wounded by Azog but is rescued at the last minute by Bilbo Baggins, who is then surrounded by Fimbul and many other hunter Orcs who, on orders from Azog, attempt to kill the small Hobbit, but are ultimately halted by the arrival of Eagles who proceed to kill many of the Orcs and Wargs present before rescuing the stranded and outnumbered party of Dwarves as well as Gandalf the Grey and Bilbo. Fimbul survives the Eagles' attack and is last seen at Azog's flank as he screams in anger as his plans to finally sever the blood line of Durin were thwarted.
In The Hobbit: The Desolation of Smaug, Fimbul first follows Azog to the house of Beorn attempting to capture Thorin Oakenshield and the Company, but Azog is forced to retreat due to Beorn's presence. On the same evening, his son Bolg arrives with a message to return to Dol Guldur. Bolg then takes the mission to hunt down the Company and Fimbul joined him as a lieutenant alongside Narzug. He follows Bolg all the way to Lake-town, where Bolg's party attacks Legolas, Tauriel, and Bard's family. Fimbul stays in a boat outside the house until an orc runs out and jumps into the boat, catapulting Fimbul up to the door where he is killed by Legolas, being beheaded; who is pursuing the escaping Bolg and his Orcs.
In the film, as the Orcs continue to search for the Dwarves, Fimbul dips his finger into a pool of blood on the ground and tastes it, spitting in disgust and says ""Dwarf blood!"". That mimics a scene from the film adaptation of The Two Towers, where Gimli dips his finger in a similar fashion into some blood left on some leaves and tastes it, only to spit out in disgust and say ""Orc blood!"" (The Hobbit (films))

 Behind the Scenes 
Fimbul was portrayed by Stephen Ure in The Hobbit: An Unexpected Journey and The Desolation of Smaug. He also portrayed Goblin Grinnah in the first film.
Ure had also worked with Peter Jackson in two films of The Lord of the Rings trilogy as two different Orcs: Grishnákh, who was the Orc who tried to kill Merry and Pippin and Gorbag, the Orc who took Frodo captive in Cirith Ungol.
Fimbul is a word in Norse mythology, meaning ""terrible"". Hypothetically, this is where Tolkien based the orc Golfimbul's name from, and in turn that name was shortened to make Fimbul.

Weapon

Peter Jackson's films or other media

Actor
John Rawls



Yazneg was a character in (and created specifically for) Peter Jackson's The Hobbit film series. He was a fierce Orc captain and Warg-rider. In the film he is the right hand and second-in-command to Azog the Defiler, leading his Hunter Orcs after Thorin Oakenshield and his band of Dwarves.

Contents[show]
 Etymology 
His name means ""Nameless""[1] in a fan-made Gundabad Orkish dialect.

 Portrayal in adaptations 
 The Hobbit: An Unexpected Journey 
    Yazneg, while chasing the Thorin and Company  
Yazneg's early life is not known of; the only thing known is that he was born in Gundabad or Moria around the time of the War of Dwarves and Orcs. Yazneg was first seen spying on Thorin and the other Dwarves, after they make camp on a rocky outcrop in the Lone-lands. Yazneg then orders his lieutenant, Fimbul, to report the Dwarves' location back to their master, Azog.
Later he was seen leading an all-out assault on the Dwarf party in an attempt to kill their leader, Thorin - however the Orcs are distracted by the wizard Radagast the Brown, using his Rabbit-pulled sled to outrun the Orcs and their Wargs. This distraction does not last as Yazneg is able to detect the Dwarves and focuses his attack on them in a last-ditch effort to claim the head of their leader, Thorin Oakenshield, for his master. Just as Yazneg and his Orcs are going to strike the Dwarves in their hiding spot, Elrond and his Elvish bodyguards arrive and kill many of the attacking Orcs and Wargs, causing Yazneg and his subordinate, Fimbul, to flee for their lives.

    Yazneg about to be killed by Azog  
After being ambushed by the Elves and failing to kill Thorin, Yazneg and Fimbul travel back to Weathertop where the Orc hunters have made their camp.
Yazneg then reports to his commander, Azog, of the Elvish ambush and Thorin's escape. Upon hearing of Yazneg's failure to kill the Dwarf leader, Azog makes an example of the Orc by picking him up off the ground by his throat and throwing him to the Wargs, where he is torn apart and killed. Fimbul the Hunter then succeeds Yazneg as Azog's right hand.

 Behind the scenes 
    The LEGO Yazneg  
An official LEGO Hobbit line webpagedescribes the character thusly: ""A brute Orc who has perfected all the wits and charms that come with that title. Red-eyed and mean as a devil, Yazneg pummels all creatures great and small that have the misfortune to cross his path.""[2]
There is a discrepancy between the Lego set Attack of the Wargs, which contains the model of Yazneg, and the movie The Hobbit: An Unexpected Journey on which the LEGO set is based

    Yazneg in Weta Digital's Making of Azog. This is during Anazulbizar, while Yazneg was in the role now filled by Azog.  
The LEGO model of Yazneg appears in a LEGO set depicting a scene in the movie where the Heroes are trapped in pine trees and use magically enchanted pine cones as fire grenades. However, in the movie the character of Yazneg was killed prior to this scene. Additionally, the LEGO model of Yazneg rides a white Warg, which the character of Azog is normally associated with. The meaning of this was revealed in Weta Digital's Making of Azog. Yazneg was originally intended to be the leader of the Warg Riders. But, Jackson decided to change the character to the 7-foot tall pale Orc, Azog, late in the filming. The Lego set was created while Yazneg was still the leader. 
Yazneg was played by the actor John Rawls.

In The Hobbit: The Desolation of Smaug, Narzug operates as one of Azog's lieutenants. Later he accompanies Bolg as he tries to hunt down Thorin Oakenshield and the Company, but is captured by Tauriel and Legolas in Mirkwood after attempting to shoot Legolas in the back, as the elf watches the Dwarves being carried further down the river. Narzug is killed by Thranduil, who beheads him after a contentious interrogation session during which he had taunted Tauriel about the impending death by poison of ""the black-haired archer"", who'd been shot with a morgul arrow from Bolg (by a morgul bow), and warns Thranduil about a building power in the south, whom he calls ""The One"". In the same hour, he meets his demise there.

Narzug is a unlockable character in LEGO The Hobbit: The Video Game. He can be found near Forest River, next to the pier. He wields a bone-crusher instead of a normal Orc  scimitar. However, his interrogation scene is missing.  In the game Legolas captures him and fixed him to a tree, leaving him alive. Later, he appears along with Bolg. He convinces Azog to attack Thorin's Company in Beorn's house. In the film, Fimbul is the only Orc who convinced Azog. Also he show in wounding Kili, but in the film, Bolg wounds Kili with an arrow.

Grinnah was an Orc of Goblin-town who worked as an interrogator for the Great Goblin during the Quest of Erebor. He appeared to be a significant member, as he directly reported to the Great Goblin when they capture Thorin and Company. However, Grinnah met his end when he was stabbed to death by Thorin.

Contents[show]
 Portrayal in adaptations 
In TA 2941, when Thorin and Company fell into the caverns of Goblin-town, Grinnah, along with a large group of Orcs, captured them, took their weapons, and led the Dwarves to their chief. Like the other orcs, he too was offended when Balin cried out to their chief that his song was an abomination. He told the Great Goblin about the Company's identification and where his group had found them, and was ordered to search their belongings. Grinnah, during the search, was surprised to find Elven objects in Nori's bag (which were objects that Nori had stolen back in Rivendell) and suggested to his chief that the Company had been in league with Elves.
Whilst the Orcs continued searching and the Great Goblin sang, Grinnah found Thorin's sword and, wondering what sword it was, opened the holster, and threw the sword aside causing the other Orcs (including the Great Goblin) to murder the Company. When Gandalf arrives to rescue the Dwarves and they take up arms to fight their way out, Grinnah fought against Kili, but the Dwarf impaled him through the chest.

 Behind the Scenes 
Grinnah was portrayed by Stephen Ure through voice and motion capture in The Hobbit: An Unexpected Journey, who also portrayed as the Orc Fimbul in the same film and The Hobbit: The Desolation of Smaug. He also portrayed the Orcs Grishnakh and Gorbag in the Lord of the Rings films.

Algund was oldest of an outlaw band, and had been a Man of Dor-lómin living under Húrin when Húrin was Lord of Dor-lómin. After the Nirnaeth Arnoediad, he was forced to flee his homeland traveling down the Vales of Anduin. Apparently destitute, he became part of a group of outlaws that raided others for their needs in Brethil and near the borders of Doriath. When Túrin joined the group, Algund in time came to recognize him as the son of Húrin.[1] After Túrin slew Forweg, the original leader of the group, it was Algund that supported him as their new captain figuring that he would be a better leader, and lead them to better fortunes.[1][2]
Later, when the group captured Beleg, Androg argued that he should soon be killed for spying, but Algund advised to wait until Túrin returned.[2] He was most likely slain in the Sack of Amon Rûdh.[3]

Edain (House of Hador), Gaurwaith



Forweg was an Edain of the House of Hador and the original leader of the outlaw company known as 'the Gaurwaith'.

 Biography 
Forweg was probably one of those that fled the Nirnaeth Arnoediad with others of the outlaw band like Algund and Andróg. He was a large man, bold but wise and generous at times - although how or why he became the leader of Gaurwaith is not known. He and his men once encountered Túrin after trailing him in the Woods of Brethil. He allowed Túrin to join them when he saw his strength and resolve. On day Forweg and Andróg had disappeared without Túrin's knowledge and others laughed when he asked about them, then weary of the outlaws squalid camp, Túrin wandered into the woods far from the camp. Suddenly, Túrin heard the cries of a woman being chased by men through a hazel-thicket. When her pursuer emerged from the thicket, Túrin struck him down killing him. When he looked down he saw that it was none other then Forweg, their leader. Hearing what the woman said about Forweg and Andróg, he discovered they had intended her harm and warned the others to leave her alone or face death despite their anger over the death of Forweg. Túrin then assumed leadership of the group.[1]

Egalmoth was an Ñoldorin Elf-lord of Gondolin in the First Age.

Contents[show]
 Biography 
Egalmoth, along with Glorfindel and Ecthelion, was Aredhel's escort when she left Gondolin in search of the Sons of Fëanor. The escort was not admitted into Doriath and traveled to Ered Gorgoroth instead. Egalmoth and his companions were separated from Aredhel and when they could not find her, they returned to Gondolin empty-handed.

 Fall of Gondolin 
Egalmoth was the wealthy Lord of the House of the Heavenly Arch. He defended the realm with valor but after the fall of the gate he was forced to flee, but not before gathering survivors. Before their escape through Idril's Secret Way, he and Tuor fought the enemy in the Square. When it was clear that the situation was hopeless, he escaped via the secret way thus surviving the Fall of Gondolin. He fled to the Mouths of Sirion with fellow survivors, and later died in the attack by the Sons of Fëanor.[1]

 Etymology 
The name Egalmoth has unclear origins, though it is likely to have been Sindarin. The first element egal has many possibilities to its origin, including eglerio or egleria (""praise, glorify""), egnas (which is rather appropriately found in both Ñoldorin and Sindarin), or êg (""sharp point""), eglon or eglir (which were names given to the Ñoldor by the Sindar), or egol (""forsaken""). The second component of 'Egalmoth' is likely to have come from the Sindarin word moth (""dusk"").

","Tim (perhaps Tim Bombadil) is the 'nuncle' of Tom Bombadil, mentioned in the poem The Stone Troll.

 Background 
While running with his big boots on, Tom ran into a Stone-troll eating the shinbone and skins of his nuncle Tim. The troll had been gnawing on the bones for several years. Tom tried to convince the troll to return the bone, mentioning that Tim had been gone for many years. He mentioned it should have been in a graveyard (Barrow-downs?). The troll admitted that he stole the bones from a hole, and it was okay for him to take them because Tim had been dead before he found the shinbone. Tom was upset that the troll would take the bone without asking first, for the shin of his father's kin. He asked for the troll to return the bone, but the troll threatened Tom, that if he didn't leave, he'd eat him as well (that meat would be better than bone). He attempted to capture Tom, but Tom slipped away behind him and kicked him from behind (not even putting a dent into the flesh of the troll), hurting his toes in the process, and losing his boot. Tom hobbled home without his boot, or his nuncle's bones. The troll stayed behind and continued to gnaw on Tim's shin.

 Behind the scenes 
Published in the Adventures of Tom Bombadil. This is a story within Hobbits stories, myths and legends, and likely based on their interpretation of Tom probably being a man, but long lived, rather than a powerful force of nature. As such Tim may not have actually existed.
Note that Tim is probably a Buckland name given to Tom's nuncle, similar to Tom Bombadil (who added the name along with the ancient ones he already carried)

Fangluin Bluebeard was one of the wicked dwarves (Nauglath) of Nogrod told in The Book of Lost Tales 2.

 Backround 
He was aged, and had counselled his fellow dwarves not to return King Tinwelint, the elven king's loan of half the elves treasury. He later jeered at them after they returned having only been paid with bronze and iron like common smiths. He was joined by Ufedhin and Naugladur in secret council of the dwarves of Nogrod seeking revenge.

 Behind the scenes 
His name was later apparently changed to Fangorn 'Treebeard' - which was recycled into the name of the Fangorn Forest, and Treebeard the ent.
At the time of writing the Hobbit, in early writings ""Giant Treebeard"" was to be a 'giant' and one of the children of Morgoth.
Dwalin's blue beard in the Hobbit may have been inspired by this character, or even possibly an decendent down the house of Nauglith (of the two houses of the dwarves stated in drafts of the Hobbit).[1]

Naugladur was the Lord of Nogrod; the King of the Wicked dwarves of Nogrod in the earlier forms of the legendarium.

 Biography 
Naugladur hired Orc mercenaries to aid in the assault on Artanor (Doriath). His Dwarves were more prone to evil to gain their own ends, and exclusively impelled by greed; that Doriath was laid waste by mercenary Orcs under Dwarvish paymasters. Dwarves in the original conception were altogether more ignoble than they afterwards became, more prone to evil to gain their ends, and more exclusively impelled by greed; that Doriath should be laid waste by mercenary Orcs under Dwarvish paymasters. He was slain in the Battle of Sarn Athrad.[1]

This content is considered pre-canon.While the subject of this article or section is based on official information, it was replaced or heavily revised in later versions of the legendarium.","The Nauglath (named in differing versions Nautar, Nauglir, and Nornwaith[1]) are one of two Wicked dwarf clans appearing in The Book of Lost Tales. They were ruled by Naugladur of Nogrod and were related to the Indrafangs (Longbeards).
""Nauglath"" can also generically refer to the two Dwarven clans as a whole in the Lost Tales. This race would later become known as the 'Petty-Dwarves' (to distinguish them any of the Seven Houses of the Dwarves).
Nauglath is also the basis for the word Nauglafring (otherwise known as Nauglathring or Nauglathfring), which was the Necklace of the Dwarves.

 Background 
The earliest known legends suggest that Melkor created the Úvanimor, bred from the earth, who were monsters, Giants, Ogres, and the Nauglath.[2] The Dwarves appear to be one of the Uvanimor related to Goblins. Fangli/Fankil/Fukil, the child of Melkor and his servant, entered into the world perverting men. They fought the Ilkorins (a kindred of Elves). The Ermon allied with Nuin at the Battle of Palisor. Fankil's forces were either defeated, but some may have fled away becoming wild and savage tribes who worshiped Fangli and Melkor. Thereafter Pelisor was possessed by Fangli and his hosts of Nauglath. Later Fankil with the Dwarves and Goblins went among Men, and bred estrangement between them and the Elves; and many Men aided the Dwarves.
The Nauglath were the kin of the Indrafangs (the ""Longbeards""). They are a strange race, and none knew exactly where they came from. They served neither Melkor nor Manwë, and they had no concern for Elves or men. Some claim they had not heard of Ilúvatar, or in hearing disbelieve. In crafts and sciences and in the knowledge of virtues of all things in the earth or under the water none excel them; yet they dwelt beneath the ground in caves and tunneled towns; Nogrod was the mightiest of these. It is said they are very old, and that no child comes among them, nor are they able to laugh. They are squat ins stature, and yet are strong, and their beards reach to their toes. However, the beards of the Indrafangs are the longest of all, forked, and they bound them to their middles as they walked abroad. All these creatures have Men called dwarves, and they say that crafts and cunning surpass that of the Gnomes (Noldor Elves), there is however little beauty in their works. It is said that some of the Gnomes joined in league with the Dwarves of Nogrod. The Dwarves were freely in trade with the Noldoli selling swords, coats of mail, and other smithwork of great skill.[3]
The Dwarves desired the gold of the Elves, and asked the king to allow them to work their craft on their treasuries. It was agreed under the guidance and skill of Ufedhin the Noldoli, that the gold and one of the Silmarils would be loaned to the dwarves in Norgrod to work their skills on. To which the Dwarves claimed they would fashion things for the adornment of the king and queen such that they had never seen, nor any Gnome or Dwarf had made yet.
The king broke his agreement with Ufedhin and the dwarves, capturing them. Telling them they would remain hostages until the treasures had been returned to his halls. He mistrusted them and thought they were thieves, or that their greed would turn them into thieves. In place of Ufedhin, the gold was brought to Nogrod by one of the craftsman's companions. Meanwhile Ufedhin manipulated the king with descriptions of the treasures they would make, and began to weave dark plots in order to ensnare the king in avarice and revenge for his capture.
In these legends, Mîm the fatherless is the captain of the guard of Glorund the Drake (later known as Glaurung), one of the greater minions of Melkor. Mîm is put in charge of guarding the great dragon's treasure in his absence. Following Glorund's death by Turin, Turin comes to Glaurung's hoard. Mîm uses dark spells to curse the treasures so that no others may touch it without troubles following them. Turin smites him soon after the curse, and takes the treasures back with him to Doriath.

 Background 
So different were the early versions of the dwarves in Tolkien's early writings that he ended up replacing the Nauglath with the 'petty Dwarves', to distinguish the people of Mîm from Durin's Folk and their peers, the kindred of the Seven Houses of the dwarves.[4]
The locations of the Longbeards also were switched at a later point to Nogrod instead of Belegost. With the other clan later (Broadbeams) switched to Belegost.
It's not entirely clear whether Nautar means the same thing as Nauglath. However, it may be possible that Nautar is the clan name, and Nauglath is the race name incorporating both the Nautar and the Indravangs. But since Nauglath is used as the name of the entire race and when talking about those of Nogrod, this is not clear.
Some elements of the stories of the Nauglath is reintroduced in Beren and Lúthien (2017), though the term does not appear (other than in the term ""Nauglafring"").

","Blodrin was a treacherous Elf whose story was told in the The Lays of Beleriand and in The Shaping of Middle-earth. He grew up among the wicked dwarves in Nogrod and developed their personality and greed.

 Background 
He was the son of the Elf Bór/Ban. As a child the hostile bearded Dwarves dragged him to their deep mansions in Nogrod. Here he was nurtured and tought to spite his blood and birth, and to hate both Elves and Men. He had lived long with the Dwarves and developed a personality similar to the wicked Dwarves he grew up among, and was evil of heart.
Later in his life, he joined Turin's outlaws for the love of plunder. Much like the Dwarves, he lusted for treasure for his greed for gold was as great as the Dwarves he had been raised within, and as great as the Hell-dragon's. He loved the new life in which wounds were more plentiful than booty. However, he hated Hurin's offspring and the bowman Beleg.
In the end he betrayed the hiding places of Turin. He fled their fellowship and forest dwellings and allied with Orcs. He bargained with them for Gold, and thus he betrayed his fellowship to the Orcs in the forest hideouts. Surprising them, the traitor and the orcs killed many men through treachery. Turin was captured and Beleg was buried in a pile of bodies, though he escaped death. But in the end Blodrin was killed by chance in the gloom, a poisoned arrow from his evil allies struck him in the throat and held him fastly to the tree behind, making it appear as if he was standing.
The sinister effect of Elvish association with the wicked dwarves had on Blodrin followed after that as it had done to Ufedhin.

 Behind the scenes 
The story of Turin's traitor went through several revisions, and apparently became the basis for the emergence of Mim as the traitor of the outlaws who had lied with the orcs, and betrayed their location.
However, in early writings (The Shaping of Middle-Earth), Mim and Blodrin were two seperate characters (Mim was the guardian of Nargothrond hoard) and their stories were later merged.
Undergoing further revisions in Tolkien's later works Blodrin became Blodren in The Grey Annals with a similar but different story. These revisions took place after the publication of The Lord of the Rings.

 Portrayal in adaptations 
 The Hobbit film trilogy 
In late Third Age, Sigrid lived in Lake-town along with her father Bard the Bowman, brother Bain and younger sister Tilda. After her father returned home, Sigrid was very happy, greeting him and explaining that she was getting worried since he had been gone all day. However, it is revealed that Bard was smuggling a group of Dwarves led by Thorin II Oakenshield. When she noticed the Dwarves and their Hobbit companion Bilbo Baggins coming out of the toilet, she asked her father why they were there. After Thorin and the rest of the Dwarves ventured to reclaim the Lonely Mountain that was stolen from Smaug the Terrible, Sigrid walked outside when she heard a noise. Thinking it was her father, she calls out for him until she was attacked by an Orc, who was part of Bolg's hunting party to find and kill Thorin. The Orc shoves her roughly into a bench at the table, which she hides under, pulling her sister close. They were eventually saved by Legolas and Tauriel, who were following Bolg and his Orcs, and defeated them. After been saved, Sigrid and her sister try as much to restrain a dying Kili in order to allow Tauriel to heal him with the Athelas plant that she obtained from Bofur.
During the onslaught of Smaug, she escaped the town with her sister, the Elf Tauriel and the Dwarves. They relocated to the ruins of Dale. After the Orcs attacked Dale, Sigrid and her siblings hid in the Great Hall on the main square, although their journey there was beset with dangers.

Giant, sapient spiders, also known as the Children of Ungoliant, lived in particularly in dark and perilous places (affected by the power of evil) in Middle-earth. Those who spoke were vicious and malevolent creatures, and their presence was typically seen as a blight.

Contents[show]
 Description 
These Spiders could speak to one another, as shown in The Hobbit. Like Orcs and Goblins, they detested the light, yet thirsted for it and sought to devour it.
They lived in the south of Middle-earth in the First Age, having descended from spider-creatures of the Ered Gorgoroth, but by the Third Age they spread to other areas far away. After the shadow of Sauron fell upon Greenwood the Great, many spiders came and lived there, and the forest became known as ""Mirkwood"".
Shelob, in Mordor, was their relative.

 History 
The first Dark Lord, Melkor, used Ungoliant to help him destroy the Two Trees of Valinor and steal the Silmarils.[1] Ungoliant, who had an insatiable desire to devour light, demanded the Silmarils. Melkor refused and she attempted to kill him. Ungoliant was subsequently driven off by Melkor's Balrogs, and she ultimately wandered across Middle-earth, consuming anything that gave light such as gemstones; and often mated with other large spiders. Her offspring were a great bane on the world in later years. She was described as surrounded by ""an aura of darkness"". Her fate is unknown, but it is said that, always hungry, Ungoliant ended by devouring herself.[2]

    The Mirkwood spiders  
The Hobbit Bilbo Baggins and his thirteen Dwarf companions encountered giant spiders in Mirkwood on their Quest to the Lonely Mountain. They managed to capture and entangle in webs each of the thirteen Dwarves. Only Bilbo's magic ring and his Elven blade (Sting) allowed them to escape from being eaten.[3]

    Frodo caught in Shelob's web, as depicted in the third film  
Frodo Baggins and Sam Gamgee encounter the lone, giant spider Shelob in her lair, within caves near Cirith Ungol, as they were trying to enter Mordor in their quest to destroy the One Ring. Frodo was ambushed by her twice, and paralyzed by her poison on the second encounter.[4] Sam used Sting to attack Shelob and wound her, which caused her to flee.[5] Her fate is unspecified.

 Influence of spiders in Tolkien's life 
Contrary to popular belief, the reason that Tolkien featured spiders so prominently in his stories was not because he was bitten by a tarantula when he was young, but rather because his son was afraid of them. From this they are portrayed negatively, always appearing as antagonists.

 Portrayal in adaptations 
    Mirkwood Spiders crawling over Radagast's home  
 Films 
 The capture of Frodo by Shelob and her battle with Sam are depicted in the film The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King.

 Giant spiders appear briefly in the first Hobbit film, where they are seen attacking Radagast's home in Rhosgobel, only to retreat back into the forest, seemingly repelled by his magic. Radagast later tells Gandalf that they came from Dol Guldur.
 In The Desolation of Smaug, the spiders capture the Dwarves in Mirkwood. As in the book, the spiders are capable of speech that Bilbo can understand when he is wearing the One Ring. They were voiced by Brian Sergent and Peter Vere-Jones in the film.

    The giant spider Saenathra, from the War in the North game adaptation  
 Video games 
 Giant spiders appear in many Lord of the Rings video games, including The Return of the King
 In The Battle for Middle-earth II and its expansion pack, Spiderlings are a unit that can be trained by the Goblins faction; Shelob also appears as a hero for the Goblins. The Goblins have a ""spiderling lair"" fortress extension that spawns smaller spiders which attack nearby enemies.
 For The Hobbit video game three spiders were invented named Wicked, Wild, and Wrath. These three spiders are the queens of the Spiders of Mirkwood and are three of the bosses of the Flies And Spiders level.

 The Lord of the Rings: War in the North features a giant spider named Saenathra, who took Radagast captive, and must be defeated to free him. Like the Mirkwood spiders from the Hobbit, she has the ability to speak.

 LEGO: The Lord of the Rings 
In LEGO The Lord of the Rings, the player must go through Shelob's Lair and kill at least six small spiders with Sauron's mark on their back.

 The Lord of the Rings Minecraft mod 
In the Lord of the Rings Minecraft mod, spiders can be found in Mirkwood and Nan Ungol. There are three delineations:

 Mordor spider
 Mirkwood spider
 Utumno Ice spider

Albert Dreary was a Man of Bree in the Third Age, in Peter Jackson's film trilogies.
He is non-canonical, and is not in the books.

 Portrayal in adaptations 
 The Hobbit: The Desolation of Smaug 
    Albert in TA 2941  
In TA 2940, when Thorin Oakenshield came to Bree to have a visit at the inn of the Prancing Pony after failing to find his father Thráin in Dunland, Albert went out of a pub looking drunk, and ate the tip of a carrot before he departed.

 The Fellowship of the Ring 
Many years later in TA 3018, when Frodo Baggins, Samwise Gamgee, Peregrin Took, and Meriadoc Brandybuck went to visit the inn to meet with Gandalf, Albert appeared once again eating a carrot and belched as they went past him.

 Trivia 
When Peter Jackson was playing Albert in The Fellowship of the Ring he originally was smoking a pipe. However after a few takes he felt sick of the smoke, and so instead used a carrot. He did the same in his next appearance. 
Albert Dreary was portrayed Jackson in The Fellowship of the Ring and The Hobbit: The Desolation of Smaug, who was the director of the film series. His name was identified at the Internet Movie Database (IMDb) and in the Middle-earth Role Playing card game.

Galdor was an Elf of Gondolin during the First Age.

 Biography 
Galdor was the Lord of the House of the Tree. He was a great warrior and second only to Turgon in valour. The house of the tree was a numerous house, and with the House of the Hammer of Wrath the first to confront the enemy in the battle of Gondolin. In the wrath of their onset they caused the Orcs to ""fall like leaves.""
Galdor saved the lives of Tuor and Ecthelion during the battle of Gondolin. Tuor, bearing the wounded Ecthelion, came to the Square of the Well. Here were Galdor and his elves defending the place and as Tuor came he stumbled beneath Ecthelion and fell and had it not been for the rush of Galdor coming to his aid, Tuor and Ecthelion would have been slain by the Orcs. Galdor escaped with the remaining refuges the fall of Gondolin and came to the Mouths of Sirion. He was leading the company of refugees but was attacked by an ambushing orc-party. Despite the surprise of the attack he fought off the orcs with some loss to his kin, most of which inflicted by falling rocks rather than orcs.
It was known he fought with an iron-studded club but he may also have used a sling like others in the house of the tree.
He survived the onslaught of the Sons of Fëanor and was rescued by Círdan and Gil-galad and sailed to the Isle of Balar. It might be that Galdor of the Tree is the same Galdor who was sent to Rivendell by Círdan from Lindon.

Salgant was an Elf of Gondolin.

 Biography 
Salgant was the Lord of the House of the Harp in Gondolin. He was heavy and squat, and owned a harp of gold. He presided over a noble house of valiant warriors loyal to the realm and the King, but had character flaws. Despite his inadequacies, he was a friendly Elf and knew Eärendil as a child; he often played with him and taught him to play music with the wooden pipes he made for him. He was said to have fawned on Maeglin.[1][2]
Unfortunately, Salgant was a traitor and was persuaded by Maeglin to join in his conspiracy to seize the kingship of Gondolin for himself, though the prospect frightened Salgant. In furtherance of this, he used his position to persuade Turgon to hold the city at all costs. When the attack came, the King ordered Salgant to defend the Great Market with Glorfindel and his house of Elves. In an act of betrayal he countermanded that order and sent his warriors to the Lesser Market instead, but they rebelled.[1]
He fled in fear and disappeared. His fate is unknown. Eärendil mourned for him when he heard that his childhood friend was not amongst the survivors.

Percy was a Man of Lake-town who worked as a porter in the Gate of Lake-town. He later assisted Bard as his second-in-command during the Battle of Five Armies.
He is non-canonical as he is not from J.R.R. Tolkien's books.

Contents[show]
 Portrayal in adaptations 
 Peter Jackson's The Hobbit Trilogy 
In the year TA 2941, Percy checked in Bard as he re-entered the town on his barge with Bilbo Baggins, Thorin II Oakenshield and his company of Dwarves stowed away in wine barrels from the Woodland Realm hidden in fish. As Bard declared that he was tired and ready to go home to see his son and daughters (who were worried about him), Percy observed the papers, stamped them, and commented the same, but before he allowed him to pass, Alfrid Lickspittle, the Master's second-in-command, who is suspicious of Bard as he is not licensed to bring in shipments of fish from Mirkwood. Percy watched as Alfrid orders Braga and the guards to to dump the fish in the lake before Bard threatened the counselor that the citizens would rebel against the Master if they heard that he was dumping fish in the lake as food was scarce. After Alfrid ordered them to stop dumping the fish, Percy then ordered the guards to raise the gate and allow Bard to sneak the Dwarves into his home.
Later that night, Percy was among the citizens that gathered when Thorin and Company were arrested and brought to the Master of Lake-town and Alfrid. However, when Thorin Oakenshield revealed himself to be Heir of Durin's Folk, Percy and the whole crowd cheered for the mountain-king's return. However, the Company's attempt to kill Smaug failed when the dragon awakened and believed that the people of Lake-town were responsible for aiding the Dwarves to kill him. As Smaug flies into rage, erupting from the mountain in a fiery wrath and loosing his flame upon the land, and flies over to Lake-town, Percy managed to survive the devastation that Smaug caused. After Bard successfully managed to kill Smaug by firing the last Black Arrow into the beast's vulnerable spot on his belly, Percy witnessed this and told the survivors that Bard killed the dragon. Percy became very loyal and supportive to Bard and accompanied the survivors to the ruined city of Dale which was once ruled by Lord Girion (Bard's ancestor).
After Thorin refused to share any of the treasure with the Lakemen, Percy was promoted to second-in-command in Bard's army and accompanied his king to the entrance of the Lonely Mountain with the aid of Thranduil and an army of Silvan Elves of the Woodland Realm. Before the battle started between the Dwarves, Men and Elves, Percy witnessed the arrival of Azog's army who then attacked Dain II's dwarf army. Returning to Dale, Percy led a number of archers to defend the city when hundreds of Guldur Orcs began to infiltrate it. In a deleted scene, a Guldur Olog-hai attacked several men including Percy who attempted to fight back with his bow, however the troll used a club to crush all of its attackers including him. Strangely, Percy managed to recover from his injuries and was seen blowing a horn to honor the fallen after the battle was won.

 Behind the scenes 
Percy was portrayed by Nick Blake in Peter Jackson's The Hobbit: The Desolation of Smaug and The Hobbit: The Battle of the Five Armies. Strangely, in a deleted scene from the latter he is seen being killed by a Guldur Olog-hai who crushes him with a club, however he is seen again blowing a horn following the battle. In another deleted scene Bard states that all of Dale's bowmen are dead, suggesting that he had incorrectly assumed Percy to be dead.

Braga was captain of the Lake-town guard.
He is non-canonical as he does not appear in any of the books.

Contents[show]
 Portrayal in adaptations 
 Peter Jackson's The Hobbit films 
    Braga arresting Thorin and the Dwarves.  
In TA 2941, when Bard the Bowman was sneaking a company of Dwarves into Lake-town by smuggling them in fishing barrels, although Braga accompanied Alfrid Lickspittle, the Master's second-in-command, who became suspicious of Bard as he is not licensed to bring in shipments of fish from Mirkwood. Under Alfrid's command, Braga ordered his men to dump the barrels of fish, which carried the the Dwarves, back into the water, but Bard was able to convince Alfrid not to since the morale is low in Lake-town due to dwindling food supplies.
While Bard was leading the Dwarves through Lake-town, they were spotted by several guards, but the Dwarves managed to knock them until Braga and his men arrived. When Braga wanted to know what was going on and ordered every citizen to stay where they were, Bard approached to him and offered him a white dress, saying that it would look lovely for Braga's wife. Braga angrily takes the dress from Bard and left with his guards. After giving the dress to his wife, Braga and his men captured Thorin and the Dwarves that were stealing weapons and brought them to the Master. He was present when Thorin Oakenshield revealed his identity to him and everyone else in the town, and convinces the townfolk, including the Master, that he and his company will share the riches of the recaptured mountain if they are provided weapons and boats and allowed safe passage to the mountain.
The next night, when Bard hears the rumbling caused by Smaug's awakening and attempts to affix the last Black Arrow to the town's wind lance, Braga and his men tried to arrest him, but Bard was able to avoid them until Alfrid and the Master were able to stop him. After arresting Bard and placing him in the cell, Braga and his men were drinking and celebrating at the time when Bard awoke and noticed Smaug flying over to Lake-town. At the sound of the bells, Braga and the guards left the prison (with Bard who was still in there) and ran to the Master's headquarters and escaped in a boat with a large quantity of gold. While trying to make their escape through the fires, Bard and his son managed to kill Smaug with the last Black Arrow and the dead body of the dragon fell in the boat, killing the Master, Braga and the guards, who were all crushed by Smaug's dead body.

Hilda Bianca was a woman of Lake-town who worked as a market trader and sold Athelas plants. She was the first to spot Thorin II Oakenshield and his company and gossips to some citizens of what she saw.

Contents[show]
 Portrayal in adaptations 
 Peter Jackson's The Hobbit films 
    Hilda in Lake-town  
In TA 2941, when Bard the Bowman was smuggling the Dwarves in the town, Hilda noticed them walking in the town while she was examining her plants that were known to be Athelas, a healing herb that was first brought to Middle-earth by the Númenóreans. She was among the citizens who witnessed the Dwarves fighting and knocking out the guards before they could arrest them. When Braga and his men arrived to find out what was going on, Hilda quickly dropped one of her plants to knock out one of the guards that was waking up and hid the Dwarves from sight. After the incident, Hilda later gossiped to a Net Mender and his partner of what she had saw earlier and the word would later spread all over town that the Dwarves have came to reclaim the Lonely Mountain.
She was among the survivors that escaped Smaug's attack on Lake-town in a boat, and makes it alive to the shores of the Long Lake. While passing out warm jackets, Alfrid came by and demanded that she passed him one. Hilda refused and told him that he wasn't in charge anymore. This caused Alfrid to grab her and attempted to kill her for insulting him, but Bard and his son Bain managed to stop him in time and save Hilda's life. She was quite surprised and happy that Bard was alive and pledged her loyalty to him. When Bard declared that they must move on, she questions him on what the people should do. Together, Hilda and the people of Lake-town took shelter at the ruined city of Dale.
During the battle between Dale and the Lonely Mountain, when a legion of Guldur Orcs were breaching the walls of Dale under the command of Azog the Defiler, Hilda was sent to hide in a building with the rest of the women and children. After impatiently and anxiously waiting, she finally gives in and declares that the rest of the women should fight and defend their home as well. Many agree with her and each grab a weapon, followed by the rest of the group. When a bundled up ""woman"" is revealed to be Alfrid, Hilda once again insults him for being a filthy and greedy coward. She leads the people out of the hall and they charge directly at the oncoming Orcs that were coming their way. Hilda doesn't back down, and she proves her strength in plunging her weapon into an orc's chest. She survived the battle as she was present at the ceremony.

 Behind the Scenes 
Hilda was portrayed by Sarah Peirse in The Hobbit: The Desolation of Smaug and The Hobbit: The Battle of the Five Armies.

""Attack is the best defence.""
—Saelon, to Borlas[1]

Saelon was a man of Gondor, and one of the principal characters from The New Shadow.

Contents[show]
 Biography 
As a young boy, Saelon was caught by Borlas stealing an apple from his orchard. Borlas described his actions as ""orc's work"", and Saelon was angered at that. Then, he heard tales of Orcs and did not forget them. He was the childhood friend of Berelach, Borlas's youngest son, and was often in his company.
One day, Saelon mentioned to Borlas something about a Dark Tree, and the leader of the secret cult, Herumor. Afterwards, he returned to his father,[note 1] after urging Borlas into meeting with him that night, and that he would be robed in all black.[1]

 Character 
Saelon was described as a ""sinister, young man.""[1]

 Etymology 
The name Saelon might have been related to the Sindarin sael (""Wise"").[citation needed]","

 Biography 
Berelach was a childhood friend of Saelon, who was caught by his father Borlas and taken to his home for scolding. They had been constant companion since then, though they seldom meet after Berelach was stationed at Harlond, and then moved to Pelargir. He told his father about the ""disappearing shipmen and small vessel at the Fleet.""[1]

 Etymology 
His name might be translated to the Sindarin beren (""bold"")[2] and lhach ("" leaping flame"").[3]
The earlier names for him were Bergil [note 1] and then later changed to Berthil.[4]

Morwë, along with Nurwë, refused the summons of the Valar to Aman.

 Biography 
Upon discovering the awakening of the Elves in Cuiviénen, the Vala Oromë traveled back to Valinor to bring news. When Oromë returned to the Elves, he invited them. Ingwë, Finwë, and Elwë served as their ambassadors. The ambassadors returned three years later to persaude the other Elves to come to Aman. Morwë and Nurwë refused the summons, leading the Avari in Cuiviénen.[1]

 Etymology 
The Quenyan mor means (""black"") and the suffix -wë occurs in many names, though not exclusively masculine.[2]

Nurwë was an elf from Cuiviénen who refused the summons of the Valar.

 Biography 
When the three ambassadors of the Elves, Ingwë, Finwë, and Elwë returned from Aman, they invited the other Elves to travel there. However, Nurwë and Morwë refused, thus leading the Avari left behind.[1]

 Etymology

The Fire-drake of Gondolin, also called the Beast of Gondolin, was a dragon who, in earlier versions of J.R.R. Tolkien's legendarium, participated during the Fall of Gondolin in FA 510.[1]

Contents[show]
Biography
He arrived over the western walls of Gondolin, carrying Balrogs upon his back. During the ensuing chaos, Ecthelion and Tuor were confronted by the Urulóki and it almost trampled on them. Tuor then hewed the foot of the beast. The fire-drake was said to have sprouted flames and screamed, and he lashed his tail and killed many Orcs and Gondothlim in his agony. Thus, Tuor and Ecthelion were able to escape the beast.[1]

Herefara was a Rohirrim warrior who served King Théoden during the War of the Ring. He fought and died in the Battle of the Pelennor Fields. 
His name was remembered in the Song of the Mounds of Mundburg.[1]

Etymology
Herefara is Old English for ""war-traveller"".

Portrayal in adaptations
In The Lord of the Rings Online Herefara comes from the town of Woodhurst in the Stonedeans, a province in the western Rohan where many men have a mix of Rohirrim and Dunlending ancestry. His grandparents are Briant and Reeve Heremond; and his parents are Cynethryth and Herubrand. Under the influence of Saruman, in early March T.A. 3019 a conspiracy of men attacks the Reeve's family in the Mead Hall of Woodhurst. Heremond and Cynethryth are slain but Herubrand, who is wounded, is saved by his loyalist who hide him and his mother outside the city. They enlist the player, an outsider who could not have been involved the attack, to help them in uncovering the conspiracy and eventually take back the control of his city. Herefara is not present during these events, as he is leading the defence of Brockbridge, a village ruled by Hama's father Léoferth to the south from the forces of Isengard. Herubrand and Herefara are later met in the Druadan Forest during the march of Rohirrim towards Minas Tirith. Herefara joins the player in patrolling the lands around beacons Nardol and Eilenach. During the Battle of the Pelennor Fields the father and son fight side by side, but are slain by Gothmog's orcs.

 Biography 
    Berembor before the battle of Helm's Deep  
During the War of the Ring, when the One Ring had awoken from its long sleep and was ready to return to its rightul master, Berembor was among the elves that refused to leave Middle-earth and chose to aid anyone who would fight against the armies of Mordor and Isengard. She accompanied Haldir of Lorien to Helm's Deep, a large valley in the north-western Ered Nimrais. There, she and her kin would aid King Theoden and his people in defending the keep from an army of 10,000 Uruk-hai that were dispatched by Saruman to wipe out the people of Rohan. Stationed at the Deeping Wall, she was seen between Erethón and Celebrílad when Aragorn walked pass them, informing all elves to show no mercy to the Uruk-hai that were preparing to charge. As the Uruk-hai were charging towards the fortress, including the Deeping Wall, Berembor and the elves loaded their bows and demonstrated their unmatched proficiency of archery, loosening devastating hails of arrows in seconds, killing many Uruk-hai. She was eventually killed during the Battle of Helm's Deep.

Belurion is a Silvan Elf and a Galadhrim Warrior from the realm of Lothlórien during the Third Age.

 Biography 
    Belurion charging against the Uruk-hai.  
During the War of the Ring, Riodur was among the elves that followed Haldir of Lorien to the fortress of Helm's Deep, in which the Rohirrim and their king were surprised by their arrival. Belurion and the elves were later stationed on the Deeping Wall, which ensured that every fortification of the Hornburg was manned. As the battle started when Aldor accidentally fired an arrow at the Uruk-hai, killing one by hitting him in the neck, Belurion and the elves demonstrated their unmatched proficiency of archery, as they loosened devastating hails of arrows in seconds, killing many Uruk-hai that were charging towards the Hornburg and the Deeping Wall. After the wall was blown by a group of Uruk-hai sappers that laid charges (which were prepared by Saruman) in the culvert under the wall, Belurion and the remaining elves were rallied by Aragorn for a counter charge against the Uruk-hai that were pouring through the large gap that was made from the explosion. He was killed when he was stabbed by Uruk spears.

 Notes 
Belurion is not seen in the books.
He is featured in the Decipher Trading card game.

Talion was captain of the rangers of Gondor. He was married to Ioreth and had a son with her, named Dirhael. 
Talion is the player-controlled protagonist in Middle-earth: Shadow of Mordor and Middle-earth: Shadow of War alongside Celebrimbor, with whom he shares a body.
He is non-canonical as he does not originate from the works of J.R.R. Tolkien.

Contents[show]
 Portrayal in adaptations 
Talion was born in Gondor. At some point after marrying Ioreth and fathering a son, Dirhael, he joined the Rangers of Gondor, quickly rising through the ranks to become captain. He killed a nobleman in defense of his wife, and instead of being executed was appointed to the Black Gate as a punishment by a sympathetic judge. Because Sauron had been gone for over three millennia, life at the Black Gate was usually uneventful, and Talion would often pass the time taking care of his family and sparring with his son. One fateful night, however, Sauron and his Black Captains returned, putting everyone at the Gate to the sword until only Talion and his family remained. After being ritualistically murdered by Sauron's Black Hand and left for dead, Talion learned he had been bonded with Celebrimbor's wraith, who offered to help him find the ones responsible for murdering him and his family.
Agreeing, he will use anything the Wraith (who has his own motives) gives him to kill those responsible. Talion hunts down and kills Uruk Captains, and makes a reluctant alliance with Ratbag the Coward, helping Ratbag become a War Chief. During this, Talion encounters Gollum (searching for his ""Precious""), who is able see the wraith form of Celebrimbor (whom he calls the ""Bright Master"").
Gollum helps them to find gifts of The Bright Master's past that, through touching them, grants visions of Celebrimbor's past. Collecting and finding the gifts, he learns Celebrimbor was an Elf-Lord who had helped Sauron create the rings of power.

    Talion in the region of Nurn  
Helping Hirgon, a former soldier from the Black Gate, destroy the statue of Sauron at an Uruk stronghold, the Hammer of Sauron comes and (seemingly) kills War Chief Ratbag (for being the only surviving War Chief). Talion battles and kills The Hammer. Afterward, he meets Lithariel, the daughter of Queen Marwen, who claims to be able to assist Celebrimbor with his mission. Marwen is the ruler of Núrn, a kingdom of sea raiders located in the south of Mordor. She uses prophetic powers to guide Talion and Celebrimbor to another of Celebrimbor's relics.
Talion also gets help from a Dwarf hunter named Torvin, teaching Talion the ways of the hunt to dominate Caragors and Graugs (beasts native to Mordor), eventually fighting a massive Graug from Torvin's past who killed Torvin's hunting partner, later revealed to be his brother. Later, Marwen advises them to use Celebrimbor's powers to take control of an army of orcs and other beasts, using them to lead an assault against Sauron.
Talion eventually realizes that the wizard Saruman is possessing Marwen, and assists Lithariel in freeing her from his control. Talion, however, still carries out Saruman's plan, leading an army of mind-controlled orcs in an assault against the Black Hand's stronghold in the Ered Glamhoth. However, rather than the Black Hand, Talion finds the Tower of Sauron waiting for him. The two battle and Talion emerges victorious after viciously stabbing the Tower to death with his son's sword.
Talion now returns to the Black Gate for a final confrontation with the Black Hand. The Black Hand quickly incapacitates him with a spell that also restores the last of Celebrimbor's memories. He then kills himself as part of a ritual that forces Celebrimbor to depart from Talion and merge with himself. This allows Sauron to possess the Black Hand's body and incarnate in physical form. However, Celebrimbor is able to briefly paralyze Sauron from within, allowing Talion to destroy Sauron's physical form. With the Black Hand dead, Celebrimbor wishes to depart for Valinor. Talion instead convinces him to stay and attempt to overthrow Sauron. Gazing at Mount Doom, Talion declares his intention to forge a new Ring of Power.

    Talion on a Caragor  
Talion and Celebrimbor forge a new ring for Talion to use, a pure ring that is not corrupt. Celebrimbor, however, is captured by the spider Shelob, and she forces Talion to give her the ring so that he can save Celebrimbor. With this ring Shelob sees into the future, she sends Talion and Celebrimbor to Minas Ithil. Here they find it to be under attack by Sauron and the Ringwraiths. Talion learns that this is because in the city there is a palantir.
Talion travels to Minas Ithil and quickly comes to odds with Celebrimbor. Talion wants to help his fellow Gondorians, while Celebrimbor believes the city is already lost and the retrieval of the Palantir must take priority. Talion reasons that protecting Minas Ithil will also protect the Palantir and he meets up with the city's defenders: General Castamir, his daughter Idril, and his lieutenant Baranor. Together, they sabotage Orcish efforts to break into the city until Castamir betrays them, allowing the Orcs to breach the gates and handing over the Palantir to the Witch-king of Angmar in return for sparing Idril. Talion fought with The Witch-king, who nearly defeated him and Celebrimbor. Castamir is killed by the Witch-king and Talion is escaped thanks to the help of Eltariel, an Elven assassin working on Galadriel's behalf. The Witch-king seizes Minas Ithil, renaming it Minas Morgul. With the Palantir, Sauron realizes that Shelob is holding Celebrimbor's Ring and sends the Nazgûl to attack her. Talion and Eltariel are able to save Shelob, who returns the Ring to him and tells him that the fate of Middle-earth is in his hands.
With the Ring back in his possession, Talion begins to use its power to dominate Orcs and build his army. During this time, he assists Idril and Baranor rescue Gondorian survivors, helps the forest spirit Carnán defeat the Balrog Tar Goroth, helps Ratbag defeat a traitor, and hunts the Nazgûl alongside Eltariel. Eventually, Talion builds up enough strength to assault Sauron's fortress directly. During the battle, Talion faces Isildur, now corrupted into a Nazgûl. Talion manages to defeat Isildur, and he and Celebrimbor use the New Ring's power to break Sauron's hold over him. Celebrimbor attempts to dominate Isildur, but is stopped by Talion, who horrified by this, frees Isildur by killing him. Celebrimbor lashes out angrily that Isildur would have been a valuable asset to their cause, leading Talion to realize that Celebrimbor's desire for revenge and thirst for power has corroded all reason, and that if he obeys, a ""Bright Lord"" will rule over Middle-earth instead of a dark one. Talion refuses to follow Celebrimbor's orders any more, causing the wraith to abandon him, possessing and giving his ring to Eltariel instead.
Without Celebrimbor, Talion begins to die, but is visited by Shelob in a vision. Shelob informs him that if Talion had gone on to fight Sauron, they'd have succeeded and Celebrimbor would have enslaved Sauron and marched on to conquer the rest of Middle-earth. She implores Talion to continue to fight to contain the darkness within Mordor as her goal was to prevent the rise of Celebrimbor. Deciding to put his fate in his own hands, Talion dons Isildur's Ring of Power to preserve his own life. He then uses the power of Isildur's Ring to assault and seize Minas Morgul, defeating the Witch-king in the process. Talion then takes possession of the Palantir and observes Celebrimbor and Eltariel making their assault on Sauron. The two manage to gain the upper hand and Celebrimbor attempts to dominate Sauron, only for Sauron to cut off Eltariel's ring finger and merge himself with Celebrimbor. As a result, Sauron and Celebrimbor remain trapped in Sauron's tower in the form of a flaming eye as their spirits continue to battle for dominance. Talion decides to use Minas Morgul as a fortress to keep Sauron's forces contained in Mordor and out of Middle-earth for as long as he can. By doing this, Talion hopes that by keeping Mordor in a constant state of war, the rest of Middle-earth can prepare for Sauron's coming.
Decades later, Talion eventually succumbs to the corruption of Isildur's ring and joins Sauron's forces as a Nazgûl, replacing Isildur. He goes with the others to hunt Frodo and the One Ring and pursues Frodo from the Shire to Bree. Like the rest of the Nazgûl, he lost his horse at the Ford of Bruinen and received a Fellbeast as his new mount. Talion was also present at the Battle of the Pelennor Fields and Battle of the Black Gate. However Talion's prior efforts were not in vain as he bought Middle-earth enough time to prepare enough for Sauron which eventually lead to the destruction of Sauron and the One Ring. Talion dies with the rest of the Nazgûl, killed when his fellbeast is struck by debris from the final eruption of Mount Doom following the One Ring's destruction and his spirit is freed. He is last seen in the afterlife discarding his weapons and armor as he walks off into the sunrise, finally able to rejoin his family once again.

 Personality 
Talion is a rather humble individual, and as captain of the Black Gate was respected by the men under his command. After the death of his family and subsequently revived by Celebrimbor, Talion became stricken with remorse for being unable to save his wife and son and set out to kill those responsible. Even after being possessed by Celebrimbor, Talion's kindness and humble attitude still remained, and he often verbally sparred with Celebrimbor about protecting humanity. Eventually, this came to a head when Talion opted to free Isildur, instead of enslaving him. Celebrimbor then betrays Talion and leaves him, effectively killing him. Instead of dying, Talion learns that Shelob's only goal was for Talion to prevent the rise of Celebrimbor who would turn out to be a much bigger threat than Sauron, as Talion would be unable to resist and would lose himself to Celebrimbor, who would march over Middle-earth and conquer the entire world. Realizing he must keep fighting, Talion opted to take on Isildur's ring and accepted his eventual fate as a Nazgûl, once again putting the greater good in front of his own desires. Even with his impending fall, Talion bravely fought Sauron and his forces for many decades, holding Sauron's forces in Mordor and refusing to allow him to march over Middle-earth, using what little freedom he had left to buy time for the forces of Middle-earth to prepare for the coming of Sauron.

 Skills and abilities 
Being a ranger of Gondor for most of his life, Talion is a skilled swordsman and archer. Adept with swords and daggers, he can hold his own against multiple Uruks at once, amplified thanks to his new Wraith abilities. His experience as a Ranger has also provided Talion with a reasonable degree of stealth efficiency, as he is also adept at moving swiftly and quietly to eliminate his enemies without being detected. Talion is a skilled freerunner, capable of scaling large walls, slack-lining ropes, and vaulting over Uruks in combat. After Celebrimbor betrays him and leaves Talion for dead, Talion takes the ring of recently killed Nazgul Isildur, to prevent himself from dying to continue his war to save Middle-earth from the forces of evil, whether it'd be against Sauron or Celebrimbor. The ring not only allows him to use any powers he was granted by Celebrimbor and the New Ring, but also enables him to raise the dead, and bear his own new wraith form, which resembles the other Nazgul.

 Wraith abilities 
 Undead: Being dead, Talion returns to Mordor as a wraith (Celebrimbor's spirit bound to Talion's body), and so cannot fully die. After Celebrimbor betrays him, he takes Isildur's ring which keeps him alive and still allows him to return from death.
 Amplified physical abilities: Talion's already formidable physical might, resilience, stamina and endurance are greatly increased by Celebrimbor's wraith powers and then increased significantly more when Celebrimbor's wraith leaves his body and he takes one of the Nine Rings made for Men.
 Domination: With his wraith abilities, Talion can dominate a Uruk with the hand of Celebrimbor. With this ability, Celebrimbor can interrogate and get information, kill the Uruk, or dominate and brand the Uruk. These enemies will then perform tasks such as gathering intel, spreading dissent, or attempting to assassinate their peers, underlings and commanders.
 Wraith World: Talion can see within the Wraith realm. This gives him the ability to see humans, Uruks, Caragors, etc. through walls, or to single out important entities such as Uruk Captains or War Chiefs.
 Attacks: Talion can round his attacks, causing his sword to glow blue, gaining the ability to execute his target or ground slam. He can stun enemies with a single punch, providing an opportunity to strike and temporarily slow time for better aim with the bow and arrow. Talion can also chain an attack, giving him the ability to slice an Uruk's head clean off.
 Shadow Strike: Allows Talion to teleport to his enemies' location and quickly kill them, as well as easily navigate over the terrain
 Shadow Pull: Talion can also pull an enemy toward his location and kill them.

 Raise Dead: After equipping the ring of Isildur, Talion can raise dead orcs or humans to fight for him. Talion uses this ability to retake Minas Ithil from the Witch-king by rising those who died when it was lost. Noticeably, while Talion doesn't seem to mind undead orcs, undead Gondorians are let go once he doesn't need their help.
 Elven Light: Talion can strike with his hand into the ground to create a flash of light that will kill any enemies in range.

 Behind the scenes 
Talion is voiced and portrayed via motion-capture by Troy Baker, who is known for other roles in video games (such as The Last of Us and Bioshock: Infinite). Talion's name comes from the Latin phrase lex talionis, or the law of talion, known today as ""eye for an eye"".

Uin was a great whale that served Ulmo, being entitled as the primeval whale or Gulma's great whale, with Gulma being an earlier name for Ulmo[1], or oldest of the Right Whales.

Contents[show]
 Etymology 
Originally, the Gnomish term uin (""wave"", and later ""whale""). Another Gnomish for whale is uimoth (""sheep or shepherd of waves"").[1] Moth stands for ""sheep"" or ""1,000"", indicating its original meaning of ""flock"" (e.g. mothweg means ""shepherd""). 
Obscure similarity of etymology between Uin and Uinen was noted[1], and she and her spouse had a cross with the whale for pulling the island.

 In Tolkien's other works 
The whale's physical features are rather unclear although according to the Roverandom, Uin was the oldest of the Right Whales (Eubalaena sp.).
Uin was the oldest and mightiest of all whales. Uin was also in charge to carry important figures. 
It was unknown whether Uin was actually one of Ainur to have own shapes like the Great Eagles. Some speculate that Uin could have been one of ancient beings present on Arda in likeness with Tom Bombadil.
Uin was noted to be one of crossovers among Tolkien's works.[2]

He is non-canonical, a character made specifically for the 2009 fan-film Born of Hope.

Contents[show]
 Portrayal in adaptations 
 Born of Hope 
Shaknar was the chief of an Orc party from the Misty Mountains sent by his master to search for a ring and bring an end to the line of the Kings of Gondor and Arnor. 
At a hidden cavern in the Misty Mountains, Shaknar met with his lieutenants who had returned from the search for the ring. Seeing as none of them were the one Sauron was seeking, he got frustrated at their incompetence as well as their fear of the ""ghost-men"". Angered by one of his lieutenants questioning his methods, Shaknar ruthlessly stabbed him to death. He then left, threatening the others that he was going to report their failure to Sauron at Dol Guldur.
Shaknar later led his party of Orcs in an attack against the village of the Dúnedain. Pointing Gorganog towards Arathorn, he fled the scene and was later forced to retreat with the remainder of the band. Arathorn pursued them, killing many of the Orcs but Shaknar shot two arrows in Arathorn's body from the shadows and the Dúnedain chieftain fell in the ground. Coming towards his victim to kill him, taunting him that the line of kings neared its end, Arathorn replied by saying that he was wrong and stabbed Shaknar's chest. 
Screeching in pain, Shaknar used what he had left of his force to stab Arathorn's eye with an arrow, before succumbing to his wounds and dying.[1]

 Biography 
During the time when the War of the Ring began when the One Ring had awoke and was ready to return to his rightful master Sauron, Githramir was among the elves that refused to leave Middle-earth and prefer to fight against the enemies of Mordor. Unlike the War of the Last Alliance that happened at the final year of the Second Age and the beginning of the Third Age, Githramir accompanied Haldir of Lórien to the old fortress of Helm's Deep where they aided King Théoden and his small army in defending the fortress of Saruman's army of 10,000 Uruk-hai that were tasked by their leader to destroy the people of Rohan. To prevent such atrocity, Githramir and kis kin were stationed on top of the Deeping Wall. As the Uruk-hai prepared to lay siege, Githramir loaded his bow and killed a number of Uruks throughout the battle. However, he was among the elves that were killed in the battle, but his life along with those that fought and defended the fortress would be honored by King Théoden for defending Rohan and its people.[1]

Orollon was a Silvan elf and a Galadhrim warrior from the realm of Lothlórien.

 Biography 
During the War of the Ring, when the One Ring had awoken from its long sleep and was ready to return to its rightul master, Orollon was among the elves that refused to leave Middle-earth and chose to aid anyone who would fight against the armies of Mordor and Isengard. She accompanied Haldor of Lorien to Helm's Deep, a large valley in the north-western Ered Nimrais. There, she and her kin would aid King Theoden and his people in defending the keep from an army of 10,000 Uruk-hai that were dispatched by Saruman to wipe out the people of Rohan. Stationed at the Deeping Wall, she was seen with several elves when Aragorn walked pass her, informing her and the elves to show no mercy to the Uruk-hai that were getting ready to charge. As the Uruk-hai were charging towards the fortress, including the Deeping Wall, Orollon and the elves loaded their bows and demonstrated their unmatched proficiency of archery, as they loosened devastating hails of arrows in seconds, killing many Uruk-hai. She was eventually killed during the Battle of Helm's Deep, but her death and everyone who was slain in the battle was honored by Théoden.

Moments before Saruman's army was coming, Melisilion was stationed on the Deeping Wall and demonstrated his skills as an archer by shooting down many Uruk-hai that were charging towards the wall and the Hornburg. Just as the enemy was getting closer to the wall, Melisilion kept on firing until he was shot down by an Uruk archer. After the battle was over, Melisilion was honored by Théoden, along with those that gave their lives in defending Rohan's country.

During the time of the battle, Unaldor was anong the archers that were called by Aragorn to open fire on the a battalion of Uruks that were moving up the causeway towards the gate. At Aragorn's command, he opened fire and shot down a number of uruk-hai that kept on moving. It is unknown if he survived the battle, but since his death was never shown, it is most likely that he was one of the fewer elf survivors that returned to Lothlórien and live throughout the Fourth Age after the One Ring was destroyed, resulting the death of Sauron.

","Avranc was a Man of Brethil during the First Age, son of Dorlas.

 Biography 
Avranc was once a man under Manthor's authority, who was a lord of the Haladin. When Manthor's company came across Húrin Thalion near Haudh-en-Elleth, after the death of Morwen, Avranc broke Manthor's command by running ahead to the house of Hardang the Chieftan, without leave, to tell Hardang of Manthor's bringing Húrin to him.
Hardang later made Avranc a Captain of Brethil during the time of Húrin's imprisonment there. When a battle broke out after the 301st Folkmoot of Judgment, at which Húrin was put to trial for his wrongdoings against Hardang, Manthor and Avranc were enemies. In the end, Avranc wounded Manthor with an arrow, and managed to escape. After Húrin's departure from Brethil, Manthor died.

 Etymology 
 Rejected names 
Farang and Faranc were two names Tolkien rejected for this character.

","Forhend was a Man of Brethil, and a guard of the Crossings of Teiglin, in the First Age.

 Biography 
Forhend was one of the guards under the command of Manthor who came across weary Húrin in Haudh-en-Elleth, immediately after the events recounted in The Children of Húrin. When Manthor, who recognized Húrin, left towards Obel Halad (the Hall of the Haladin) to assist Húrin in his errand, he took only him and Forhend along. The others of the Guard, such as Sagroth and Avranc, were to stay behind.
It is possible that Forhend was of some familial relation to Forweg, one of the outlaws encountered earlier by Túrin Turambar in lands near to Brethil.

The Black Hand in Middle-earth: Shadow of Mordor

Black Hand of Sauron

Race
Men


Gender
Male


Realm
Mordor


Culture
Black Captains


Peter Jackson's films or other media

Actor
Nolan North



The Black Hand was the greatest and the most feared of Sauron's Black Captains during the late Third Age.
He is non-canonical as his character was invented for the game Middle-earth: Shadow of Mordor.

 Portrayal in adaptations 
The Black Hand was rumoured to have once been a king from the east who brought Sauron the heads of the two Blue Wizards as gifts. Others say that he returned across the seas with Sauron after the fall of Númenor. Still others claim that he was the Dark Lord himself, taking fair form again within Mordor. As with the Mouth of Sauron, the Black Hand's true name was unknown.
He personally killed the family of Talion (a ranger of the Black Gate), both his wife and his son, and then proceeded to slit the throat of Talion himself. However, Talion was bound to the spirit of the famous Elven smith Celebrimbor and still held presence, half wraith, half man. This caused Talion to seek out the Black Hand, in order to kill him and exact his revenge, in turn weakening Sauron's grip upon Mordor.
After the formation of their army within the Uruk ranks, Talion and Celebrimbor fought the Talons of the Black Hand (his personal Uruk guards) and killed them, then ascended the Black Gate, where the Black Hand awaited them. The Black Hand showed Celebrimbor a memory of his past and attempted to force him to leave Talion's body by using his connection to the darkness. Abruptly, Sauron emerged in the Black Hand's place and assaulted the weakened Talion. However, Talion was able to join with Celebrimbor again after striking him down. He left the Black Hand weakened, giving the ranger an opening to stab his heart, finally killing the Black Hand forever.
During his life, his mere presence on the battlefield spread terror among his foes and servants alike. He represented Sauron's manipulative and deceitful nature, and was likewise himself a master of deceit, serving the Dark lord with absolute loyalty.

The Hammer of Sauron was one of Sauron's Black Captains during the reconquest of Mordor in the late Third Age. 
He is non-canonical as he does not appear in the works of J.R.R. Tolkien, and only in the video game Middle-earth: Shadow of Mordor.

 Portrayal in adaptations 
The Hammer is one of Sauron's Black Captains alongside the Tower of Sauron and the Black Hand of Sauron. He was once a man, a stretcher-bearer for Gondor dedicated to retrieving the wounded. His life changed on the slopes of Mount Doom when he retrieved Sauron's mace after the Dark Lord fell. When he took up the weapon of Sauron, he realized that his life had been wasted in saving others who sought glory in war. If Men wished to die gloriously in battle, he would grant them their wish with pleasure.
He became doomed to a bloodlust that would never be sated. He has waited millennia for the Dark Lord's return to Mordor and when he returned his purpose had been revealed to him. He is later slain by Talion, a ranger of the Black Gate and the protagonist of the game.
As with the Mouth of Sauron, the Hammer's true name is unknown.

Gimli was a blind, elderly Ñoldor Elf in the First Age.
Biography
Long a captive slave in the stronghold of Tevildo, Gimli possessed an extraordinary power of hearing for which he became famous to the elves of Tol Eressëa in later times.
After Lúthien captured the golden collar of Tevildo, she ordered that all the slaves of Elves and Men that were bound in the tower be released, and brought before her. But only Beren and Gimli still lived. Gimli was an aged Gnome bent in thralldom at this time, and had grown blind, but his hearing had grown keen over time. He walked with a stick, and Beren aided him. They escaped together.
It was said that he had the keenest hearing in all the world, such that songs were sung about it.

 Behind the scenes 
The Gnomish Lexicon has gimli ‘(sense of) hearing’, with gim-‘hear’, gimriol ‘attentive’ (changed to ‘audible’), gimri ‘hearkening, attention’.
He plays no part in The Tale of Tinúviel or in any other tale, and never reappears. (The Tale was originally part of the The Book of Lost Tales Part Two, but is also the first section of the later publication Beren and Lúthien.)

","Ufedhin was an Elf of the First Age notable for his treachery of Thingol, king of Doriath.

 History 
Ufedhin was significantly one of the corrupt elves who helped treacherous Dwarves from Belegost and Nogrod past the Girdle of Melian, and also helping to insight the Dwarves already inside the Thousand Caves to war after the cursed treasure of Mim. He appears in both ""The Nauglafring"" and the later Quenta Noldorinwa, but then mysterious vanishes from other accounts of the sack of Doriath.
The novel Beren and Lúthien uses material from the later versions of the Quenta Noldorinwa which explains that ""by the treachery of certain Elves on whom the lust of the accursed treasure had fallen they [dwarves] passed through into Doriath secret."" It appears Christopher Tolkien has taken a new route to explain how the dwarves bypassed the veil (a thorn in J.R.R. Tolkien struggled with trying to explain and had several theories, including the 'inside help from Ufedhin, but never settles on one.)

The problem of the entry of the Dwarvish army into Doriath, defended by the Girdle of Melian, is still solved by the device - the too simple device, see II. 250 - of 'some treacherous Gnomes' (in the Tale there was only one traitor); the slaying of Thingol while hunting remains, and as in the Tale Melian, inviolable, left the Thousand Caves seeking Beren and Luthien. Though it is not so stated, it seems likely that in this version it was Melian who brought the news and the warn- ing to Beren (this is the story in the Quenta, p. 160).[1]

The Black Captains were three of Sauron's most trusted servants. 

Portrayal in adaptations
Middle-earth: Shadow of Mordor
Each represented a side of Sauron, the Black Hand of Sauron was that of lying, deceit and manipulation, the Tower of Sauron was the horror and viciousness of Sauron and the Hammer of Sauron was power and might. They were among the highest ranking members of Sauron's forces, with similar status to Agandaûr and the Nazgûl during the War of the Ring.

Ratbag was an Uruk who was rescued from punishment by the ranger Talion and began to serve him, as a secret traitor in Sauron's army.
Ratbag is non-canonical as he does not appear in the works of J.R.R. Tolkien. 

 Portrayal in adaptations 
In Middle-earth: Shadow of Mordor, Talion will help him in return for information about the ten Uruk Warchiefs of Mordor. While Talion eliminates Uruks in authority one by one, Ratbag is on the way to becoming a Warchief, but is supposedly killed by the Hammer of Sauron before Talion fights him.
To the contrary, Ratbag is still alive in Middle-earth: Shadow of War, and has a fortress with his Olog-hai friend Ranger. When the player takes the fort, he says that Brûz must not be overlord and that he will betray you. At the end Ratbag is right, and after fighting with Talion against Bruz the player must shame him for what he did.

Tar Goroth is a Balrog that appears in Middle-earth: Shadow of War.

 Lore 
In the wars of the First Age, Tar Goroth was a general in Morgoth's army when the Dark Lord battled the Valar. After the defeat of the evil Morgoth, the spirit Carnán threw the Balrog at last in the fiery pits of the plains of Gorgoroth, where he now lies. 
During the Third Age, the Darkness crept back within the land of Mordor. The forging of the Bright Lord's New Ring has awakened Tar Goroth from his slumber. This has not gone unobserved by Sauron himself, who commands Zog to sway the demon to his side. Rising from the molten fires of Gorgoroth, Tar Goroth proves too powerful for even Zog to tame. Despite the best efforts of Carnán and the Bright Lord, the shadowy menace is once again unleashed upon Middle-earth. 
Following a trail of dead Orcs to Seregost, the Bright Lord and Carnán confront Tar Goroth once more upon a frozen lake. After a hefty skirmish, the two are able to bring down the Balrog and plunge it into the watery depths underneath the ice.

At some point shortly thereafter, Ioreth was attacked by the nobleman Asgon, who was killed by Talion in the act of defending his wife. Because Ioreth revealed to her father she was carrying Talion's unborn child, Hallas agreed to assign Talion to a post at the Black Gate to save him from imprisonment for the crime.

However, he was captured by the Tower of Sauron along with his family, and was with them afterwards murdered by the Black Hand as part of a dark ritual. 
Though Dirhael was slain, Talion was reanimated by the spirit of the elf-lord Celebrimbor, and was thus enabled to take vengeance for the deaths of his wife and son.

Edith Mary Tolkien (21 January 1889 – 29 November 1971; née Bratt) was the wife of J.R.R. Tolkien. She is best known for being the inspiration for Lúthien Tinúviel and Arwen Evenstar.

 Biography 
Edith Bratt was born in Wolverhampton, Staffordshire. Her mother, Frances Bratt, was the unmarried daughter of a shoe and bootmaker.[1] Edith was raised in Handsworth, a suburb of Birmingham, by her mother and her cousin. When Edith was 14 her mother died and she was sent to live at the Dresden House boarding school in Evesham. Here she developed her love for the piano.[2] Her guardian, solicitor Stephen Gateley, had her stay at Mrs. Faulkner's boarding house at 37 Duchess Road, Birmingham.[3]
Edith met Ronald Tolkien (i.e. ""John Ronald Reuel"") in early 1908, when he and his brother moved into 37 Duchess Road. At this time, Tolkien was 16 years old and Edith 19, and she lived in the floor below his. When their relationship began and became known to Tolkien's guardian, Fr. Francis Xavier Morgan, he viewed Edith as a distraction to Tolkien's schoolwork, and was bothered by her Anglican religion. He forbade them to meet again until Tolkien turned 21.[4] Tolkien obeyed Father Morgan, but on the evening of Tolkien's 21st birthday he wrote a letter to Edith asking her to marry him. She replied that she was already engaged, but implied that she did so because she thought Tolkien had forgotten her. Tolkien journeyed to Cheltenham, where he and Edith met at the railway station. She returned her ring and later would announce that she was engaged to Tolkien.[5]
Soon after Tolkien's and Edith's wedding, Tolkien embarked on a course at the British Army signals school at Otley. In order to be closer to John she moved into a cottage in the village of Great Haywood, with her cousin Jennie Grove.[6] Tolkien was commissioned as a second lieutenant into the Lancashire Fusiliers, then transferred to the 11th (Service) Battalion with the British Expeditionary Force (BEF) and arrived in France on 4 June 1916.[7] When Tolkien was serving in the Battle of the Somme it was very hard for Edith, for she feared that any knock on the door might carry news of her husbands death. In order to get around the British Army's postal censorship, Tolkien sent coded letters to Edith in order for her to track his movements on the Western Front.

 Portrayal 
In the 2019 biographical film Tolkien, a young Edith Tolkien is portrayed by English-American actress Lily Collins.

The Vanishing Sons

Founder(s)
Former Easterling military men, survivors of the Massacre of the Eastfold


Type
Mercenary organization


Revenue
Paid by the highest bidder to fight for their cause


Employees
Men formerly of the Easterling military and kidnapped orphans trained into warriors


The Vanishing Sons were an Easterling mercenary company located in Lithlad. Formerly professional soldiers of the Easterling military, the Vanishing Sons were known for their expertise in fighting and were often hired by rich leaders to fight for their cause. 
They dwelt in an ancient Númenórean fortress in Lithlad, an eastern part of Mordor.

 History 
The Vanishing Sons were born at the Massacre of Eastfold, where a brigade of Easterling warriors were sent into a hopeless battle in the grasslands of the Rohirrim. Facing a superior force of Rohirrim riders, close to a thousand men were slaughtered. The two dozen Easterling soldiers who managed to escape did not return to Rhûn and they instead took the name of the Vanishing Sons. They became mercenaries who fought for the highest bidder, whether former allies or enemies.
From their earliest raids upon Haradrim villages, they established their primary recruitment method, taking in surviving children and instructing them in the ways of war, to the extent that the Vanishing Sons transformed over time, becoming less a group of professional soldiers than a band of mercenary war orphans.
The Vanishing Sons eventually made their way to the deserts of Lithlad where they took up residence in the ruins of an ancient Númenórean fortress. Lithlad gave them a permanent home where they brokered a deal with the orcs of Shindrâm. They were left in peace and paid a monthly bounty for dealing with bandits that assaulted the marauder camps and their supply lines. The Vanishing Sons dispatched the bandits quickly and sent the heads of twenty warriors to the orcs. Lithlad grew quiet, until some months later when the mercenaries happened upon an idea that would guarantee as much work as they wanted. And so the bandit raids began again.

Zog the Eternal is an Uruk who appears in Middle-Earth: Shadow of War as a major antagonist.
He is not from the works of J.R.R. Tolkien. 

 Biography 
Zog was a skilled Orc mystic with a devout faith to Sauron. As required of his master's command, he and his group of acolytes went to Gorgoroth to use their sorcery to call Tar Goroth to take up arms in Sauron's servince. However, the demon proved too much of a challenge for even Zog to tame, shown true by how the Balrog turned upon the acolytes before fleeing to the surface. 
He remained a genuine servant to Sauron still, raising undead Orcs and slumbering followers of Morgoth back to life to threaten the plans of the ascending Bright Lord. However, his success only increased his ego and thirst for power, such that he forsook his allegiance to Sauron. In his lust for mastery, Zog committed himself to raising an army to contest his master and rule Mordor. To achieve his purposes, Zog spread his web of allies and agents throughout the Black Land in the hopes of seizing the right opportunity to strike. 
Upon Tar Goroth's fall beneath the icy surface of Seregost, Zog and his acolytes went to the frozen lake in an attempt to summon the Balrog and dominate it. The Bright Lord, however, intervened and stopped the ritual by crumbling the totems and seemingly slaying the Uruk Necromancer. 
In Minas Morgul, Zog was resurrected by his loyal followers. Intent on supplanting Sauron, the necromancer began to replenish his depleted army by reanimating the fallen Orc soldiers who had claimed the fortress in the first place. Once more, the Bright Lord arrived to challenge him and was able to overpower and defeat him. Carnán, in the form of a Drake, flew over and burned his remains so that he could never return. However, as Zog often reminded his adversaries, a true necromancer was said to never stay dead for long. 

 Trivia 
Zog is also the name of the Main antagonist from a Frank Baum Novel

Marwen was the queen of the tribesmen of Núrn in the days following Sauron's return to Mordor. 
She is non-canonical as she only appears in Middle-earth: Shadow of Mordor, and not in the works of J.R.R. Tolkien.

 Portrayal in adaptations 
Marwen ruled the lands of Núrn shortly before and in the early years of Sauron's return to Mordor. At some point, she became the mother of Lithariel. At some point prior to Sauron's removal from Dol Guldur, however, she was possessed by the wizard Saruman in his quest to find the One Ring, and was as a result aged prematurely, falling into a state of atrophy. 
Eventually, Lithariel brought the ranger Talion to Marwen's court at what she believed to be the queen's command. Through Marwen, Saruman sent the ranger on a series of missions in hopes of bringing the wraith of Celebrimbor under his control. This was unsuccessful, however, as Talion and Lithariel were able to break Saruman's hold over Marwen, restoring her mind and appearance to their natural state.
Marwen then assisted Talion in preparing for his assault on the Tower of Sauron, which proved successful. However, in his absence, the Black Hand invaded Núrn and ravaged much of the land, including Marwen's stronghold. She is presumed to have been killed along with Lithariel, but her fate is ultimately unknown.

Baranor was a Gondorian sergeant, and later captain, of Haradrim birth.
He is non-canonical as he does not appear in the works of J.R.R. Tolkien, and is only in the video game Middle-earth: Shadow of War.

Contents[show]
 Biography 
 Early life 
Baranor was born as Warad in the region of Umbar, to Haradrim parents, and had an elder brother by the name of Jagai. Brought to Gondor as a hostage of peace, Baranor was stranded after his parents' death, and adopted by a wealthy family of Minas Ithil. Eventually he became a soldier, and by the time of Sauron's return to Mordor, had risen to the rank of Sergeant.

 Defending Minas Ithil 
During the Witch-king's assault on Minas Ithil, Baranor fought to defend the gates before he and the other Gondorians were forced to retreat to the next level of the city. It was here he was introduced to the ranger Talion by Idril, who informed Baranor the ranger had come in an attempt to save the city and thus the Palantir housed there. Talion and Baranor afterwards formed and carried out a plan to take out a warchief in Cirith Ungol, who would have greatly strengthened Sauron's forces attacking Minas Ithil.
Later, while Talion created a diversion by fighting several of the Witch-king's champions in the arena of Minas Ithil, Baranor and Idril gathered intel on the whereabouts of General Castamir, who was thought to have been captured by uruks. Baranor and Idril accompanied Talion to rescue Castamir, and brought him back to the city. Soon afterwards, however, the general betrayed them to the Witch-king, giving him the Palantir and control of the city. Baranor and the surviving soldiers and inhabitants were forced to flee.

 Campaign in Lithlad 
Some time afterwards, Baranor enlisted the help of the dwarf Torvin in Lithlad in an attempt to take the citadel of Shindrâm. Shortly after meeting the dwarf, Baranor traveled to the headquarters of the Vanishing Sons, a group of Easterling mercenaries, and was surprised to find their leader was none other than his long-lost brother Jagai, now known as Serka. Despite their differences, Serka helped Baranor to take the outposts surrounding the fortress, and ultimately to defeat Shindrâm's overlord and take the fortress itself. They both would survive the attack, and laid plans to continue fighting Sauron's forces in Gorgoroth.

Realm

Carnán was a spirit of nature residing in the forests of Núrn in Mordor, who had dwelt there since before any could remember. Little is known of her history, though she long protected her forest from outsiders, particularly orcs. 
Her mortality was said to be bound to the ""Great Tree"" of her forest, which was the only place she could take human-like form. She was also known to the take the forms of caragors, graugs, and drakes.
This character was not invented by J.R.R. Tolkien; Carnán only appears in the video game Middle-earth: Shadow of War.

 Biography 
Carnán's origins are unclear, though she resided in Middle-earth by at least the Second Age, when the Balrog Tar Goroth attacked her forest, destroying much of the wildlife. She defeated Tar Goroth, resulting in the creature's imprisonment in the pits beneath Gorgoroth.
In the Third Age, following Sauron's return to Mordor, she encountered the ranger Talion and the wraith of Celebrimbor, who ventured into her forest in search of answers relating to their quest to defeat the Dark Lord. Carnán initially attempted to kill the intruders, but relented after their unexpectedly firm resistance, and informed them that their actions in Mordor had re-awoken Tar Goroth, and that he must be defeated. 
A short time afterwards, Carnán traveled to Gorgoroth, and aided Talion in battling the newly awakened Balrog, though Tar Goroth managed to escape. Carnán and Talion tracked Tar Goroth to Seregost, where they again engaged in battle with the Balrog on a frozen lake. Carnán took the form of a drake, and with Talion's help overwhelmed Tar Goroth, casting him into the depths of the lake below.
The necromancer Zog, who along with his acolytes had worked to awake Tar Goroth, soon attacked Carnán's forest and began cutting down trees as revenge. Talion and Celebrimbor managed to stop Zog‘s followers, and Carnán, having been injured, entered a deep slumber to heal. Zog then traveled to Seregost, where he began an attempt to revive Tar Goroth from the frozen lake. Talion tracked him there, and was able to kill the necromancer. Later Zog’s followers resurrected him in Minas Morgul, but Talion managed to slay him once more. It was then that Carnán arrived in the form of a drake, and burned the necromancer's remains to ash, ensuring his permanent death.

Idril was a woman and Second Captain of Minas Ithil. She was the only child of General Castamir, the city's leader.
Idril does not appear in the works of J.R.R. Tolkien, and is only in the video game Middle-earth: Shadow of War.

 Biography 
Idril was born in and raised in the city of Minas Ithil by her parents, Castamir and his wife. When she was eleven years of age, Idril's mother was killed by Orcs.
By the time of the Witch-king's assault on Minas Ithil in the late Third Age, Idril had joined the city's army and risen to the rank of Second Captain. Prior to the siege, she spent much of her time cataloguing ancient artifacts, and considered herself the city's foremost historian. She, along with her father and other officers of Minas Ithil's army, met the ranger Talion during the siege, who had come to help defend the city and secure the palantir housed there.
She, along with Baranor, personally assisted Talion in his efforts, though ultimately Castamir despaired and attempted to ransom Idril's life in return for giving up the palantir. Talion and Idril were unsuccessful in preventing this, and after the Witch-king killed Castamir, were forced to flee the city along with the remaining Gondorian survivors.
Idril afterwards traveled to Seregost with Baranor and other Gondorian soldiers in hopes of fighting Sauron's army. She was soon afterwards captured, and subsequently freed by Talion and Baranor, though Baranor himself was captured in the process. She traveled with Talion to Gorgoroth, where they were able to free Baranor, and together Idril, Baranor, and several other Gondorians left to continue fighting the Dark Lord within his domain.

Castamir is non-canonical as he does not appear in the works of J.R.R. Tolkien, and only in the video game Middle-earth: Shadow of War.

 Biography 
Castamir, a Gondorian by birth, served in the army for much of his life and became a decorated war hero. By the last days before the Witch-king's assault of Minas Ithil, he had become the city's leader and foremost general, as well as the father of Idril, who was herself a Second Captain in the city's army.
At some point prior to or during the Witch-king's siege of Minas Ithil, Castamir despaired, and made a deal with the enemy to hand the city and the palantir it housed over, in exchange for the safety of Idril. Following the arrival of the ranger Talion, Castamir secretly left to discuss terms with the Witch-king's subordinates, only to be thought captured and subsequently ""rescued"" by Idril and Talion. Soon afterwards, he granted the Witch-king and other Nazgul access to the city's tower, where he handed over the palantir, despite Talion and Idril's attempts to prevent him from doing so. The Witch-king, having obtained what he desired, proceeded to kill Castamir, forcing Idril and Talion to flee the city.
Later, the Nazgul Isildur resurrected Castamir as a Barrow Wight along with many other men of Minas Ithil in an effort to vanquish Talion.

Lithariel was the leader of the Tribesmen of Núrn in the late Third Age, and the adopted daughter of Queen Marwen, ruler of Núrn.
Lithariel is non-canonical as she does not appear in the works of J.R.R. Tolkien, and only in the video game Middle-earth: Shadow of Mordor.

 Biography 
Lithariel was at some point adopted by Marwen, the Queen of the Shore, of Núrn, and eventually became a proficient warrior. She assumed leadership of the Tribesmen of Núrn, and led them for some time against the Uruks of Sauron, who began to encroach on the land of Núrn. During this time, as Sauron declared himself openly and began building his power, the wizard Saruman was able to gain an increasing degree of influence over Queen Marwen, though Lithariel was unaware of it. 
Some time later, the ranger Talion journeyed to Núrn, seeking for a way to defeat the Black Hand and strike against Sauron's power. Saruman, hoping to gain control of Celebrimbor's wraith, which was bound to Talion, used Marwen to send the ranger on a series of quests, on which Lithariel aided Talion. Talion developed feelings for Lithariel during this time, but chose to focus on his mission and not bring further sorrow to her. Lithariel was at one point captured by Uruks, but Talion managed to rescue her before she could be executed.
On Talion's final return to Marwen, Saruman used the opportunity to attempt to wrest Celebrimbor away from Talion and bend the wraith to his own will. Talion, realizing Marwen's staff served as the conduit for the wizard's power, indicated as much to Lithariel, who broke the staff, thwarting Saruman's plan and freeing her mother from his influence. Once liberated, Marwen was able to tell Talion of the Tower of Sauron's location, and the ranger left with support from the tribesmen across the Sea of Núrnen. 
His mission, while successful, gave the Black Hand an opportunity to raid Núrn, and on the ranger's return Marwen's stronghold was devastated. Though no remains were to be found, Marwen and Lithariel, along with many of the tribesmen, were presumed to have been slain.

Eltariel was an Elf of Lothlórien, and a warrior sent by Galadriel to combat the Nazgûl during the Third Age.
Eltariel is non-canonical as she is not from the works of J.R.R. Tolkien, and is only in the game Middle-earth: Shadow of War.

Portrayal in adaptations
Eltariel was likely of the Galadhrim; there are no details given of her birth.
By the late Third Age, she had become a proficient warrior, and was selected by Lady Galadriel to confront and destroy the Nazgûl within Mordor itself. Initially, Eltariel enjoyed the challenge of hunting the Ringwraiths, but eventually she began to question her purpose, as the Nazgûl proved to be impossible to permanently destroy.
Following the creation of a new ring of power by the ranger Talion and the wraith of Celebrimbor, Talion traveled to Minas Ithil in an attempt to break the Witch-king's siege of the city, though Shelob had taken the new ring from him by force. Ultimately, the city fell, and Talion was surrounded by the Ringwraiths. The Witch-king dominated Talion in order to turn the ranger to his will, but Eltariel, ever on the trail of the Nazgûl, fought them off and broke the Witch-king's hold over Talion.
The Nazgul, discovering that Shelob held the new ring, quickly went to Cirith Ungol in order to take it from her. Talion and Eltariel followed them, and Eltariel drove off the Ringwraiths using the Light of Galadriel. Shelob decided to return the ring to Talion thereafter, and Talion left to begin his campaign against Sauron. In the following weeks, Talion conquered many regions of Mordor, with Eltariel often stepping in to assist in fighting the Nazgul. Eventually, though, during Talion's final assault on Barad-dûr, Talion and Celebrimbor came to a disagreement after defeating Isildur's wraith. Celebrimbor abandoned the ranger, and instead bonded with Eltariel, who agreed to aid him in attacking Sauron. Eltariel and Celebrimbor fought the Dark Lord at the pinnacle of Barad-dûr, culminating in Celebrimbor and Sauron being locked together in an indefinite battle, thus creating the visible Eye of Sauron.

He was soon encountered by Serka's brother Baranor, who thereafter rescued Serka from the fighting pit.

He is non-canonical as he does not appear in the works of J.R.R. Tolkien, and is only in the video game Middle-earth: Shadow of War.

 Biography 
Serka, born as Jagai, was originally from Umbar, and born to parents of Haradrim descent. His younger brother, Warad, was taken by village clerics and delivered to Gondor as a hostage of peace, though Jagai attempted to stop them. 
Soon afterwards, Jagai's village was attacked by the Easterlings of the Vanishing Sons mercenary company, who killed Jagai's parents and most of the villagers, but took Jagai and two other children. The mercenaries raised them harshly, leading to the deaths of the other children, but Jagai was hardened and worked his way through the Easterlings' ranks as he grew, taking the name of Serka. Eventually, having gained the title of ""The Unkillable"", he became the Vanishing Sons' leader.
Some time later, Baranor of Minas Ithil came to Lithlad, seeking the assistance of the Vanishing Sons. Serka soon recognized Baranor as his long-lost brother Warad and welcomed him. Serka, at the insistence of Baranor, eventually agreed to help him in taking the fortress of Shindrâm, though they initially disagreed about the venture's feasibility. During the campaign, which involved taking the outposts surrounding the fortress, Serka was betrayed by Zhója, one of his subordinates, who sold him to the uruk Ûshak. Baranor rescued Serka, who, on returning to The Oasis, had Zhója fed to the were-wyrms.
The campaign would ultimately be a success, and the fortress was captured, with both Serka and Baranor surviving the attempt.

Éomund was a Man of Rohan, and the chief captain of the Éothéod under Eorl the Young.[1]

 Biography 
In TA 2510, he presumably rode with Eorl to the Battle of the Field of Celebrant, where the Éothéod rescued Cirion, the Steward of Gondor, and his forces from the Balchoth. Afterwards, Éomund accompanied Eorl to Halifirien, where Eorl swore a great oath to Cirion, and the steward in return swore to come to the aid of the Éothéod. Additionally, Cirion gave the region of Calenardhon to the Éothéod as their own country, and in this Éomund assisted in defining the boundaries.[1]

In the video game Middle-earth: Shadow of Mordor, Hirgon is a former ranger of Gondor. He later becomes an outcast and leads a band of fellow outcast Men living in Mordor. 
This ranger is not the same Hirgon as the errand-rider of Gondor in J.R.R. Tolkien's works.

Biography
Hirgon became an outlaw wanted for deserting his posting at the Black Gate. During his desertion, Hirgon fell gravely ill and was nursed to health by a woman named Eryn, whom he would eventually marry. He later became the leader of tribe of outcast Men living in Mordor. While in Mordor, Hirgon becomes a short-term ally of the ""Gravewalker"" Talion and collaborates with him to first rescue Hirgon's wife and later to devise plans of defeating the Black Hand.
Hirgon boasts of his resourcefulness including his apparent knowledge of a substance called Hithlas, which he states is useful in poisoning Grog, a favored drink  of Uruks. He also recalled a time when he acquired a supply of blasting powder from a dwarf living in Mordor, in a supposed trade. However, Hirgon alluded that he exchanged nothing for the powder and made a swift escape with the supply.
Hirgon is successfully reunited with his wife Eryn after Talion rescues her from Uruk slavers. Despite the rescue, Eryn is distrustful of Talion, believing he has every reason not to help their outcast band of people and instead abandon them to be killed or captured as slaves of Mordor. Hirgon however, is still willing to trust and work with Talion, already holding himself in Talion's debt for his help in rescuing Eryn. Hirgon assisted Talion in destroying the site of a monument built in Sauron's image. After the desecration of Sauron's monument and the slaying of the Uruk forces guarding it, the Black Captain known as the Hammer of Sauron soon made his arrival. Knowing the strength of the Black Captains and the overwhelming numbers they would command, Talion urged Hirgon and his wife to evacuate their people from Mordor. This was the last time Hirgon or the outcasts were seen, leaving their fate unknown.

Eryn is a woman of Gondor in the late Third Age, and Hirgon's wife. She is a character invented for the game Middle-earth: Shadow of Mordor.

 Biography 
Eryn first met the ranger Hirgon after he fled his post at the Black Gate. He fell ill and it was Eryn who nursed him back to health. They eventually married. 
The couple joined a group of outcast Men living in Mordor. During this time in Mordor, Eryn was captured and enslaved by Uruks. She was later rescued by Hirgon and the ranger Talion; though she did not trust Talion and fled from him after he killed her captors. The successful rescue ended with Eryn reunited with her beloved husband.
Despite the rescue, Eryn remained suspicious of Talion, believing he was likely to capture or execute her husband for his desertion at the Black Gate. However, Hirgon remained willing to trust Talion as he felt indebted for Talion's aid in rescuing Eryn, and agreed to aid him in another mission. 
After Hirgon and Talion accomplished their mission to desecrate one of Sauron's newest monuments, news quickly spread of a large retaliatory force led by one of the Black Captains known as the Hammer of Sauron. Eryn was last seen with her husband attempting to save the life of a severely-wounded man. Talion returned to the outcast hideout to urge Hirgon to evacuate survivors from Mordor, warning them that a single Black Captain was too powerful for ordinary men to fight. It is likely Eryn followed her husband in leading survivors out of Mordor.

Sauron (or Þauron (Thauron); Quenya; IPA: [ˈsaʊron] or Vanyarin; IPA: [ˈθaʊron] - ""The Abhorred""), the eponymous Lord of the Rings, was a fallen Maia, creator of the One Ring, a gifted student of Aulë the Smith and lieutenant of Melkor (Morgoth). After Melkor's defeat by the Valar, Sauron in time became the second Dark Lord and strove to conquer Arda by creating the Rings of Power.
In the Second Age, he was defeated in the War of the Last Alliance by Elves and Men united under kings Gil-galad and Elendil. In the final battle, Isildur managed to cut off the One Ring from Sauron's finger, dismantling Sauron's corporeal form and power. After lying dormant and regaining strength for centuries, Sauron returned to power late in the Third Age, and would be permanently crippled in the War of the Ring by the destruction of the One Ring by Frodo Baggins.
He was called Gorthaur the Cruel by the Sindar.

Contents[show]
 Biography 
 Origin 
Long before the First Age, Sauron was originally the mightiest Maia of the Vala Aulë the Smith; his name then was Mairon, meaning ""the admirable"". He learned much from Aulë in the ways of smithing and handiwork, becoming a great craftsman, and ""mighty in the lore of"" Aulë's people.[2] He was among the most powerful Maiar - if not the most powerful.
During this time, Mairon was as Eru had created him: good and incorrupt. His greatest virtue was his love of order and perfection - dislike of anything wasteful. However, this would also prove to be the cause of his downfall, for, in the Dark Lord Morgoth, Mairon saw the will and power that would help him achieve his own goals and desires faster than if he pursued them alone. However, while Morgoth wanted to either control or destroy Arda itself, Mairon's desire was to dominate the minds and wills of its creatures. In truth, Sauron did not seek to serve, only to eventually command (which would prove useful in understanding the mind of Saruman); a testimony of his cunning, Sauron benefited from his former services, both then, and in later years: he presented himself as a minister of the Valar to the Elves, and later as Morgoth's prophet to the Numenoreans (when other means would not do). 
After allying himself with Morgoth, Mairon maintained his appearance of being faithful to the Valar, but secretly fed Morgoth information about their dealings. It was only when Morgoth established his strongholds in Middle-earth that Sauron left Valinor and openly declared his allegiance, thence remaining a recognized foe of the Valar and the Free Peoples of Middle-earth.
The Sindar Elves in Beleriand called him Gorthaur, meaning ""dread abomination""[3], and by others of the Eldar he was named Sauron, meaning ""the abhorred"" or ""the abominable"" (a mockery of his original name).

 First Age 
    Morgoth and Sauron, by Eric Faure-Brac  
In the First Age, the Ñoldorin Elves left the Blessed Realm of Valinor in the Utter West (against the counsel of the Valar) in order to wage war on Morgoth, who had stolen the Silmarils of Fëanor, enchanted gems that glowed with light from the now-destroyed Trees of Valinor. In that war, Sauron was counted as the ""greatest of [Morgoth's] servants that have names"". His only equal in rank was Gothmog, the High Captain of Angband. He was soon feared as a lord of terrible phantoms and dreadful beasts--a shape-shifter, sorcerer, and cunning servant of his master.
Before Melkor's captivity, Sauron commanded the fortress of Angband and served as Melkor's lieutenant. At the beginning of the War of Powers, the Valar forces leveled Angband with little difficulty, though it is not know for certain if Sauron was present when the fortress was attacked. When Utumno was sacked and Melkor captured, Sauron was nowhere to be found. However, in their haste to both capture Melkor and remove him from Middle-earth, the Valar paid little heed to Melkor's most terrible servants.[4]

When Melkor left Angband much later to corrupt the newly awakened Atani (Men), Sauron directed the war against the Elves.[5] He conquered the Elvish isle of Tol Sirion, so that it became known as Tol-in-Gaurhoth, the Isle of Werewolves.[6] He was the Lord of the Werewolves there, and Draugluin was the sire of the Werewolves. Sauron's herald was the vampire Thuringwethil.     Sauron and Finrod, King of Nargothrond, duel in songs of power  After Dagor Bragollach, Sauron's hunters brought Gorlim and questioned him of Barahir's (father of Beren) location. Gorlim told them none, until Sauron himself came forth and bartered with the man. Gorlim asked for his wife Eilinel, whom he thought captured. Thus, Sauron agreed and Gorlim yielded the information. However, Sauron revealed that Eilinel was dead, and he put Gorlim to death afterward. During the Quest for the Silmaril, Beren and Finrod King of Nargothrond were captured by Sauron, who defeated Finrod in a duel with songs of power. He stripped them of their Orc disguises and cast them into the dark pits where werewolves devoured their companions. When a werewolf came to attack Beren, Finrod wrestled with and killed it, but died soon after of his injuries.
Soon afterward, Lúthien and Huan the wolfhound arrived at the bridge of Tol-in-Gaurhoth. Sauron sent wolves to capture Lúthien, but all were slain by Huan. One of them was Draugluin, but he fled and told his master that Huan was there. Therefore, Sauron disguised himself as a werewolf and leaped to attack Lúthien. Huan sprang and subdued Sauron. He yielded the tower to Lúthien and escaped in a form of a ""vampire"".[7]

    Huan subdues Sauron (by Ted Nasmith)  
After his defeat by Lúthien, Sauron played little part in the events of the First Age (possibly hiding from Morgoth's scorn or wrath), and after his former master was defeated and taken to Valinor in chains, Sauron seemed to repent and plead to Eönwë and the victorious Host of the West for mercy, although he may have been daunted by their triumph. Despite this, Sauron was unwilling to return to the Utter West for judgment out of pride, and so he fled and hid somewhere in Middle-earth.[8]

 Second Age 
 Forging of the One Ring 
This is the Master-ring, the One Ring to rule them all. This is the One Ring that he lost many ages ago, to the great weakening of his power. He greatly desires it – but he must not get it.—Gandalf, The Lord of the Rings, ""The Shadow of the Past"" pg.48(Bottom)After lying hidden and dormant for five hundred years, Sauron began revealing himself once more, and by SA 1000 he gathered his power and established himself in the land of Mordor in eastern Middle-earth and began building the dreaded Dark Tower of Barad-dûr near Mount Doom. Sauron soon began raising massive armies of Orcs, Trolls, and other creatures from the days of Morgoth, as well as corrupting the hearts of Men with delusions of power and wealth, chiefly Easterlings and Southrons (the Haradrim). It may be noted that at the first he was not wholly evil, being rather of mind to rebuild Middle-Earth after the destruction caused at the battle at the end of the First Age, but slowly he was corrupted by lure of power and the 'bonds' Melkor placed upon him, causing him to revert to his old devices. However, by the late Second Age and Third Age, he was probable wholly evil, or so evil that none of the Wise were contemplating bringing him back to terms; he was considered the reincarnation of evil. 
Although Sauron knew that men were easier to sway, he sought to bring the Elves into his service, as they were far more powerful. By about SA 1500, Sauron put on a fair visage and called himself Annatar, the ""Lord of Gifts"". He befriended the Elf smiths of Eregion, including Celebrimbor (greatest of craftsmen, as he was descended from Fëanor), and counseled them in arts and magic. Not all the Elves trusted him, particularly Lady Galadriel, Elrond, and Gil-galad, High King of the Ñoldor.

    The One Ring worn by Sauron  
To the Elves who listened, Sauron gave knowledge and encouragement in forging the Rings of Power, though in secret Sauron forged his own, the One Ring, to rule the Elvish rings. Upon that ring Sauron wrote in Tengwar the Black Speech inscription, Ash nazg durbatulûk, ash nazg gimbatul, ash nazg thrakatulûk, agh burzum-ishi krimpatul. This translates as: One Ring to Rule Them All, One Ring to Find Them, One Ring to Bring Them All, and in the Darkness Bind Them.

However, as soon as Sauron put on the Ring the Elves sensed his treachery, and removed their rings and hid them. Enraged, Sauron came against them in open war and demanded that all Rings of Power be given to him. The Elves managed to hide the three greatest of the Rings from him, but the other sixteen Rings of Power were either captured by Sauron, destroyed, or lost. To the Dwarves he had given Seven, but to Men he had given Nine, knowing that they would be the easiest to corrupt. The Dwarf Lords who received the Rings proved to be very resistant to their power, and neither ""faded"" nor became enslaved to Sauron's will. The Rings, however, created in them an insatiable lust for gold, which ultimately caused a great deal of grief for the Dwarves.    Sauron's appearance in Peter Jackson's The Lord of the Rings film trilogy   As Sauron predicted, the nine Men were all corrupted by their Rings and became the Nazgûl, Sauron's deadliest and most cruel servants. Had the Elves not recognized Sauron's treachery and forsaken the power of their rings, the results would have been catastrophic for the Free Peoples of Middle-earth. It seems that most if not all of the native Men of Middle-earth succumbed to the power of the Ring once the Nazgûl were created; the Númenóreans were spared because of their distance. The Elves, had they been captured in this fashion, would have become the slaves of Sauron, and thus Celebrimbor's resistance was of immense importance in the history of Middle-earth.
In this era, during which he marshaled and commanded great armies, Sauron became known as the Dark Lord of Mordor, and his fortress of Barad-dûr was completed. He was very powerful even without control of the Elves, and he conquered nearly all of Middle-earth during the War of the Elves and Sauron. However, the armies of Númenór's King Tar-Minastir were finally able to defeat him at a last battle near Gwathló or the Greyflood in SA 1700. Defeated but not vanquished, Sauron retreated back to Mordor and began recouping his strength over the many centuries.

    Sauron overlooking his Orc army at Gorgoroth  
Towards the end of the Second Age, Sauron was once again powerful enough to raise again large armies to attempt to rule Middle-earth. By this time, he assumed the titles of ""Lord of the Earth"" and ""King of Men"". Sauron's rise in power and apparent intention to crown himself the King of all Men offended the Númenóreans; the powerful Men descended from those who had fought against Melkor in the War of Wrath. Some were the descendants, through Elros, of Beren and Lúthien.


 Life in Númenor 
These Men lived on the island of Númenor in the sea between Middle-earth and Valinor. The Númenóreans, who were then proud, came to Middle-earth with astounding force of arms. King Ar-Pharazôn, who desired no less than the kingship of Middle-earth, marched his troops all the way to Mordor without a single battle, and demanded that Sauron abase himself before the King. Sauron could see clearly that even the most powerful of his servants could not stand against the Númenóreans, and so came from Barad-dûr without any offer of battle. He assumed a fair form and flattered Ar-Pharazôn, but the King demanded that Sauron come back to Númenor as a hostage. Sauron feigned unhappiness at this development but secretly was delighted, for this presented him with an opportunity to destroy the Númenóreans from within. After only a few short years in Númenor he grew from captive to the King's most trusted adviser, and nearly all the King's court fawned upon him. Drawing on their fear of death, he converted many Númenóreans to the worship of Morgoth, lying that Morgoth had the power to save them from mortality. As his power and influence reached its peak, he raised a great Temple in which he performed human sacrifices to Morgoth. Finally, he convinced Ar-Pharazôn to rebel against the Valar and attack Valinor itself and claim it for himself.
But here, Sauron's cunning overreached itself, for Eru then directly intervened - Númenor was drowned under the sea, and the great navy of Númenor was destroyed and the army that reached Aman was buried under mountains of falling rock and imprisoned in the Caves of the Forgotten. The world was bent, so that thereafter, only Elven-Ships could sail into the Utter West. Sauron's body was destroyed, but his spirit was not diminished, and he fled back to Mordor bearing the Ring, where he slowly rebuilt a new body and his strength during the time known as the Dark Years. From this point on, he lost the ability to assume a fair shape, and ruled now through terror and force. A few faithful Númenóreans led by Elendil were saved from the flood, and they founded Gondor and Arnor in Middle-earth.

 Loss of the Ring 
    Sauron's destruction in battle by Isildur  
After learning that Elendil, whom he had especially hated, had survived and was ordering a realm on his borders, Sauron, after a while, made war with them. He struck too soon, however, and had not restored most of his strength, whereas the Elven-king, Gil-galad had increased his power on Middle-earth in his absence. Therefore, when Gil-Galad allied with Elendil to create the Last Alliance and together fought Sauron, they finally defeated his armies at the Battle of Dagorlad, and laid siege to Barad-dûr for seven years. Finally, Sauron himself came forth and dueled both Elendil and Gil-galad, slaying them both single-handedly. Then Isildur, son of Elendil, took up his father's broken sword, Narsil and cut the One Ring from Sauron's finger. Sauron's physical body was destroyed. With nearly all of his power stored in the ring, he was vanquished when it was cut from his finger. Without their leader's dark will driving them on, Sauron's armies were routed and fled, and thus, his campaign to defeat the free peoples was seemingly ended, and his greatest weapon taken from him.
But while Isildur had taken the ring, he could not bring himself to destroy it in the fires of Mount Doom where it was forged, instead he became corrupted by the One Ring and kept it for himself. He was eventually betrayed by it a few years later, and slain by Orcs at Gladden Fields. The Ring fell into the river Anduin, and was lost for centuries before being found by the two Stoorish friends and relatives, Sméagol and Déagol. Shortly afterwards Sméagol murdered Déagol for possession of the Ring.

 Third Age 
Despite his defeat, Sauron was not vanquished permanently. Though greatly weakened, and in non-corporeal form, he still existed, due to pouring most of his native power, strength, and will into the One Ring. Thus, as long as it existed, he could never be truly defeated, and during the first thousand years of the Third Age, he lay in hiding, slowly recovering his strength until he was once again able to create a body for himself.

 The Necromancer of Dol Guldur 
    Sauron's appearance as the ""Necromancer"", as shown in The Hobbit: An Unexpected Journey  
In the year TA 1000, Sauron at last began to rise again, taking the stronghold of Dol Guldur, the Hill of Sorcery, in southern Mirkwood in TA 1050. There, he was disguised as a dark sorcerer known as ""the Necromancer"", and the Elves did not realize at first that he was actually Sauron returned.
Around this time, the Valar sent the five Wizards, or Istari, including Gandalf the Grey, who later became Gandalf the White, to oppose Sauron and rally the free peoples of Middle-earth against him.
While Sauron continued to gather his strength, the Ringwraiths reappeared in the year TA 1300, and began steadily assaulting the Numenorean kingdoms in exile until, one by one, they fell. Whether the Witch-king was acting on his own or by Sauron's volition is not known.
Suspecting that Sauron had returned and was guiding the Nazgûl, the wizard Gandalf infiltrated the fortress in TA 2063 to confirm his theory, but Sauron fled into the east to conceal his identity. This marked the beginning of the Watchful Peace, which ended with Sauron's return to Dol Guldur in TA 2460. During the same year, the One Ring was finally discovered by the stoor Sméagol and his friend Déagol.

Gandalf the Grey made a second intrusion into Dol Guldur in TA 2850, and finally discovered that the Necromancer was indeed Sauron. Eventually, the White Council put forth their might and drove Sauron from Dol Guldur permanently in TA 2941. Without the Ring in his possession, Sauron could draw on only the smallest fraction of its strength, so that his enemies were able to drive him from Dol Guldur with relative ease. However, the Dark Lord, having had ample time to prepare, was willing to abandon Dol Guldur, and returned to Mordor, where he openly declared himself in TA 2951, and began preparations for his final war against the free peoples of Middle-earth.    The Ringwraiths in The Fellowship of the Ring  
 War of the Ring 
Sauron bred immense armies of Orcs and allied with and enslaved Men from the east and south. He gathered his most terrifying servants, the Nazgûl (airi in Quenya), or Ringwraiths, each wearing one of the nine rings designed for mortal men. He adopted the symbol of a lidless eye, and was able to exert his will over Middle-earth, so that the Eye of Sauron became a symbol of power and fear.
After the creature Gollum, originally the stoor-hobbit Sméagol who had originally found the ring, was captured, Sauron had him tortured and learned that he once had a magic ring, and, from him, he heard the words Shire and Baggins. He deduced that Gollum's ring was the One Ring, and sent his servants, the dreaded Nazgûl, to find Shire and search for Baggins, so that the One Ring might be found and returned to him.
Meanwhile, Sauron had compelled Saruman the White (another fallen Maia, or Istari) into his service, using the wizard against Rohan and thus removing one of the major threats Sauron faced in his planned conquest of Gondor and the remaining Elves. Saruman failed however, and Sauron lost one of his most potent vassals as well as Saruman's massive orc army of Uruk-hai.

    Aragorn reveals himself to Sauron through the Palantír  
Shortly after Saruman's defeat, Peregrin Took looked into the Palantír that the wizard had possessed and accidentally communicated with Sauron, who believed that his treacherous servant had captured either the Halflings bearing the Ring, or some who might know of it. However, shortly thereafter Aragorn took the Palantir and revealed himself to Sauron with the intent of causing him unease. Upon seeing Aragorn, the Dark Lord realized that Saruman had fallen and concluded that the heir of Isildur carried the One Ring. Fearful that his enemies would use the Ring against him, Sauron sped up his plans and attacked the city of Minas Tirith in Gondor sooner than he had planned, seeking to raze the city and crush last true human resistance to his rule before his enemies could fortify it, and to prevent Men uniting under one king.
Fortunately, due to the combined efforts of Gondor, Rohan, and the Dúnedain of Arnor, Sauron's army was defeated. Despite still possessing more than enough armies to destroy Minas Tirith and enough military strength to easily conquer Middle-earth once Gondor fell, doubt began to grow on Sauron. As such, he watched and waited, hoping for a period of strife between Aragorn and other potential Ringlords in which he could move out and take the Ring for himself.

 Downfall 
Despite their successful repulsion of Sauron's armies at Minas Tirith, Gandalf and Aragorn knew that the bulk of Sauron's forces remained in Mordor, readying themselves for another, deadlier strike against the city. Filled as Mordor was with Sauron's troops, Frodo stood almost no chance of reaching Mt. Doom undetected. In light of the situation, Aragorn called for a council consisting of the major commanders of all the forces present in Minas Tirith, and appointed Gandalf to be their overlord until the crisis had passed. Gandalf made it clear to all those present that, despite their great victory, they ultimately could not hope to defeat Sauron's armies by force. Therefore, they had two options available. They could station their remaining force, considerably greater than it had been before the battle due to the reinforcements from Rohan and southern Gondor, at Minas Tirith and hope to endure Sauron's next attack. Or, they could take a force to the Black Gate and attempt to challenge Sauron directly. This force, as Gandalf suggested, would only need to be great enough to challenge battle, and the rest of their forces could remain behind to garrison Minas Tirith. This option, though suicidal for all those involved, would serve to distract Sauron from gazing into his own land, through which the Ring Bearer would be trekking. Furthermore, Gandalf theorized that, once Sauron learned that a force too small to pose any real threat to him was on its way to the Black Gate to directly assault Mordor, he would likely believe that whomever was leading the attacking force would have the One Ring in their possession. Gandalf believed that Sauron would assume that the Ring itself would influence its wielder, and that, in the wielder's pride in his newfound power, he might be foolish enough to challenge Sauron's might with a force too small to assault Mordor in earnest.[9]
Their plot worked, as Sauron marshaled most of his remaining forces and marched them towards Udun to crush the Men of the West and regain his prize. This action left the Plains of Gorgoroth largely deserted and allowing Frodo and Sam to reach Mt. Doom with far less difficulty than they would have otherwise had. However, once Frodo reached the Crack of Doom, he finally succumbed to the power of the Ring. As he put it on and prepared to leave Mt. Doom, Sauron suddenly became aware of him, immediately drawing his gaze towards the mountain. Though enraged, Sauron was suddenly gripped with terror, having realized his own folly, and he frantically sent the Ringwraiths towards the mountain to retrieve the Ring. He was too late, however, as Gollum, after taking the Ring from Frodo, slipped and plunged to his death into the Cracks of Doom, and the Ring was unmade. The earth shook as a great shock wave rippled across Mordor, and the foundations of Barad-dûr were finally destroyed, causing the great fortress to fall into ruin once and for all. Mt. Doom was completely destroyed in a cataclysmic eruption that consumed the eight remaining Nazgul, who had left their combat with the Great Eagles to race to Mount Doom in its fiery ruin.[10]

    Barad-dûr's downfall  
With his source of power gone, Sauron was utterly defeated and his armies were destroyed or scattered, bereft of the driving will behind their conquest. With the Ring's destruction, Sauron was permanently robbed of his physical form, reducing him to a malevolent spirit that hovered above Mordor as a ""huge shape of shadow, impenetrable, lightning-crowned, ...terrible but impotent,"" only to be blown away by a great wind.[11]
With the destruction of the Ring, the vast majority of Sauron's being and his power was forever lost. With that, Sauron's power was forever crippled, and the threat of his dominion was forever removed.
""If it [the Ring] is destroyed, then he will fall, and his fall will be so low that none can foresee his arising ever again. For he will lose the best part of the strength that was native to him in his beginning, and all that was made or begun with that power will crumble, and he will be maimed for ever, becoming a mere spirit of malice that gnaws itself in the shadows, but cannot again grow or take shape. And so a great evil of this world will be removed.""—The Return of the King, ""The Last Debate""

 Etymology 
Sauron is the Quenya term for ""the Abhorred"".[3] In Sindarin, it is translated as Gorthaur from gor (""horror, dread"") and thaur (""abominable, abhorrent"").[12]

 Other names 
His original name was said to be Mairon (""the Admirable"", from maira meaning ""admirable, excellent""), a name he used while in Númenor, adding the title ""Tar"" for ""Tar-Mairon"" (""King Excellent"").[13] When disguising himself in the Second Age, he called himself Annatar (""Lord of Gifts""; anna = gift and tar = king, lord), Artano (""High-smith""), and Aulendil (""Friend of Aulë"").[14]
His name is sometimes seen written as Thauron (Þauron), an earlier pronunciation of Sauron.

 Earlier names 
Thû was Tolkien's earliest name for Sauron, in the original Lay of Leithian. Thu is reintroduced as an alternate name for Sauron in Beren and Luthien (2017).
Tevildo, before that, was the name of the forerunner character to Sauron, a ""Prince of Cats"" who is a villain told of in the stories of The Book of Lost Tales. In Beren and Lúthien (2017), Tevildo is presented as a separate character from Thu/Sauron, and one of Morgoth's other minions.

 Character 
Despite being the title character of The Lord of the Rings, Sauron is notable in that he never directly appears during the events of the trilogy. Nowhere is any detailed description given of what he looks like, other than in vague terms.
In The Silmarillion, however, Sauron is described as being a shape changer, and took many forms, including that of a serpent, a vampire, and a great wolf. After Morgoth's fall, Sauron appeared in fair form as ""Annatar"", the Lord of Gifts, and maintained this appearance until the Fall of Númenor, in which he was unable to ever take fair form ever again. The History of Middle-earth includes a passage vaguely describing how the Númenoreans saw him: ""Upon that ship which was cast highest and stood dry upon a hill there was a man, but greater than any even of the race of Numenor in stature...And it seemed to men that Sauron was great; though they feared the light of his eyes. To many he appeared fair, to others terrible; but to some evil.""[15]A few clues are given as to Sauron's appearance as the Dark Lord, after he lost his ability to take a fair form: Tolkien described Sauron in one of his letters as having the form of a man of more than human stature, but not gigantic, and as an image of malice and hatred made visible. He apparently gave off great heat, so much so that Gil-galad was burned to death by his mere touch, and Isildur described Sauron's hand as black, yet burning like fire, suggesting that his entire body was blackened from fire and heat.
Gollum, having apparently once seen Sauron directly, described him as having only four fingers on his black hand, suggesting that Sauron was unable to regenerate the finger from which Isildur took the One Ring, similar to how the wounds Morgoth took from Fingolfin never healed.
In addition to his physical appearance, Sauron also apparently had an aura of incredible malevolence. A passage in The Silmarillion describes him as having a ""dreadful presence,"" and daunting eyes.[7]
Regarding Sauron's personality, Tolkien had this to say from his letters:
In my story Sauron represents as near an approach to the wholly evil will as is possible. He had gone the way of all tyrants: beginning well, at least on the level that while desiring to order all things according to his own wisdom he still at first considered the (economic) well-being of other inhabitants of the Earth. But he went further than human tyrants in pride and the lust for domination, being in origin an immortal (angelic) spirit. Sauron desired to be a God-King, and was held to be this by his servants, by a triple treachery: 1. Because of his admiration of Strength he had become a follower of Morgoth and fell with him down into the depths of evil, becoming his chief agent in Middle-earth. 2. when Morgoth was defeated by the Valar finally he forsook his allegiance; but out of fear only; he did not present himself to the Valar or sue for pardon, and remained in Middle-earth. 3. When he found how greatly his knowledge was admired by all other rational creatures and how easy it was to influence them, his pride became boundless.—J.R.R. Tolkien[16]
Philosopher Peter J. Kreeft proposes that Sauron is in fact the main character of The Lord of the Rings, inasmuch as he has the largest significance to the work of good and evil in the story, given his shared essence with the Ring; and given the title's referral to him.

 Weapons and powers 
Sauron was among the mightiest of the Maiar. Originally of Aulë's people, he acquired great ""scientific"" knowledge of the world's substances and how to use them. He would retain this knowledge throughout his tenure as the Dark Lord in Middle-earth, using it to forge the One Ring and construct his fortress of Barad-dûr. Sauron also seemed primarily linked to the use of fire, and as Morgoth's chief lieutenant, his ability to tap into the fires in the Earth was of great value.

    Sauron's fair disguise  
Among Sauron's chief powers were deception and disguise: In the First Age Sauron took on many forms. His battle against Luthien and Huan in The Silmarillion has him taking on no less than four separate shapes: his ""normal"" shape, presumed to be that of some kind of terrible dark sorcerer, a great wolf, a serpent, and finally a vampire ""dripping blood from his throat upon the trees"" (""Of Beren and Lúthien,"" The Silmarillion). At the end of the First Age, Sauron took on a fair form to appeal to the Captain of the Hosts of the Valar and ask for pardon. In the Second Age, Sauron took up that fair form again and used it under the alias ""Annatar"" to deceive the Elves into creating the Rings of Power. The level of deception required to fool the Elves of Eregion must have gone beyond simply taking on a fair form. Sauron was literally instructing the Elves to make artifacts that while capable of great good, were ultimately purposed for his own domination and were imbued with power to arrest the natural order of the world. The Elves were unaware of who they were dealing with until the eleventh hour, and only narrowly escaped his trap. Centuries later, Sauron was able to deceive the Númenóreans and steer them directly to their own destruction under promises of eternal life. Such destruction is a testament to Sauron's manipulative nature and ability to twist the perceptions of his enemies.

    Depiction of Mordor's coat-of-arms, with the Eye of Sauron  
An interesting dichotomy is set up between his deceptive nature and his symbol. While rarely appearing personally and deceiving all but the most wary, he represented himself as an all-seeing eye that could pierce all disguises. He himself was able to disguise himself by changing shape and taking a fair form. But, after the Fall of Númenor, he was incapable of taking physical form for many years, and then later became a horrific Dark Lord. After losing the Ring, it took even longer for him to regain physical form, although, by the War of the Ring, he had regained it.
The extent, nature, and specifics of Sauron's power are largely left to the imagination. Like Morgoth, he was capable of altering the physical substance of the world around him by mere effort of will.

 Symbol 
The symbol of Sauron was the Eye of Sauron, particularly after he arose in Mirkwood at Dol Guldur. In The Lord of the Rings it is called also the Great Eye, the Eye of Barad-dûr, the Red Eye, the Lidless Eye, and the Evil Eye.

 Earlier versions of the legendarium 
Since the earliest versions of the Silmarillion legendarium (as detailed in The History of Middle-earth), Sauron underwent many changes. The prototype of his character was Tevildo, ""Prince of Cats"", who played the role later taken by Sauron in the earliest version of the story of Beren and Lúthien told in The Book of Lost Tales Part Two. Tevildo was soon transformed into Thû, the Necromancer, whose name would be emended to Gorthû, Sûr, and finally to Sauron. Gorthû in the form Gorthaur remained in The Silmarillion. In Númenor, he was once known (according to The Notion Club Papers and associated writings) as Zigûr.
Prior to the publication of The Silmarillion, Sauron's origins and true identity were unclear to those without full access to J.R.R. Tolkien's notes, so that early editions of the Guide to Middle-earth described Sauron as ""probably of the Eldar elves"".

 Portrayal in adaptations 
 The Lord of the Rings film trilogy 
You know of what I speak, Gandalf. A great eye, lidless, wreathed in flame.—Saruman to Gandalf in The Fellowship of the Ring.Sauron's primary appearance in Peter Jackson's trilogy is as the Eye of Sauron, a titanic, flaming eye atop Barad-dûr; many characters refer to it as ""the Eye"" or ""the Great Eye."" His prior physical form was as a massive being clad in nine-foot-tall black armor, seen only in two contexts: in flashbacks to the War of the Last Alliance throughout the trilogy, and very briefly in the center of the Eye in an extended scene with Aragorn and the palantír in The Return of the King. When Sauron speaks, it is telepathically through the One Ring or the Palantír; he is voiced by Alan Howard. Sala Baker portrays his physical form.
""You cannot hide. I see you. There is no life in the void, only death.""
- Sauron in The Fellowship of the Ring
As in the books, Sauron is the primary antagonist throughout the films. He is depicted as an almost god-like entity whose mere presence, even when mediated by a medium like the Palantír, causes immense pain and injury. Most of his bidding is achieved through his various servants such as the Nazgûl and Saruman, who calls him ""the Lord of the Earth."" Sauron is most extensively depicted in the prologue to The Fellowship of the Ring, shown forging the One Ring and leading his armies at the Battle of Dagorlad in the War of the Last Alliance. Owing to Tolkien's description, he is shown to be towering over men and yet not gigantic. He also wears black armor and a mask similar to Morgoth in The Silmarillion, and wields a giant mace (perhaps based on Grond) capable of killing scores of men in one hit.
Sauron was originally intended to appear in physical form at the climax of The Return of the King, appearing at the Battle of the Morannon to fight Aragorn. However, this was ultimately scrapped from the film due to the fact it was not in the book and the developers believed it would take the main focus away from Sam and Frodo. Furthermore, Jackson believed it would take away from Aragorn's act of sacrifice.
The Eye of Sauron's feline appearance is a reference to the character of ""Tevildo"" in the first drafts, who took the form of a cat.

 The Hobbit film trilogy 
It has begun. The East will fall. So shall the Kingdom of Angmar rise. The time of the Elves is over. The Age of the Orc has come.—Spoken in the Black Speech, as Sauron reveals himself to Galadriel    Sauron as he appears in The Desolation of Smaug.  
Sauron's role from The Hobbit is greatly expanded in Jackson's Hobbit film trilogy. He is voiced by Benedict Cumberbatch.
Sauron appears in An Unexpected Journey in the form of a black, humanoid ghost, alluding to Tolkien's description of the Necromancer as a man with blackened skin. He is briefly witnessed in this form by Radagast.
In the The Desolation of Smaug, Sauron reveals a greater extent of his powers. He is first seen speaking with Azog, ordering him to break off pursuit of Thorin II Oakenshield, whose head he had promised the Orc, in order to lead his armies. When Gandalf arrives in Dol Guldur to investigate tales of an evil there, Sauron first confronts him as a mass of black smoke. After killing Thráin II and initiating a brief duel with the Grey Wizard, Sauron is able to overpower the wizard and reveals himself as an armored figure within the shape of an enormous, flaming eye.
In The Battle of the Five Armies, Galadriel, Elrond, and Saruman (the White Council) travel to Dol Goldur to free Gandalf. There, Sauron releases the Nazgûl upon them, but the Ringwraiths are defeated by the Council. It is then that Sauron appears as a spectral armored form within a flaming eye, accompanied within the fire by the Ringwraiths' ghostly forms. Sauron threatens the Council with the fall of the East and the rise of Angmar, but is engaged by Galadriel (in her spectral form) in a magical duel of minds. Sauron cannot overcome Galadriel, and he flees as a ball of fire into the East. Afterward, Saruman promises the Council that he will handle Sauron personally.
The extended edition confirms Sauron has forged an alliance with Smaug, as well as showing him murdering Thrain during his battle with Gandalf.

 Video games 
In The Lord of the Rings Online, Annatar was depicted in a mural in the ruins of Tham Mírdain. He was called Antheron (Gift Lord), because Turbine doesn't have the rights to the name Annatar. In the session play quest 'Daughter of Strife' from Volume I: Book XV, where the player takes on the character of Narmaleth, Sauron is also encountered in his disguise of Annatar (Antheron), at the time he taught the elves of Eregion the secrets of the Rings. Visiting Sauron's personal chambers in Dol Guldur leads to a vision of the Dark Lord, still weak and recovering from his defeat at the hanf of Isildur. During an extended flashback sequence to the War of the Last Alliance, Sauron himself is met within Barad-dur by the player, who controls a historic character.

In the strategy game The Lord of the Rings: The Battle for Middle-earth II, Sauron is one of the Ring Heroes, the other beng Galadriel, which can be summoned when a player successfully finds Gollum and take the One Ring by killing him. He can only be summoned by the evil factions Mordor, Isengard and Goblins. Sauron is one of the strongest, if not, the strongest unit in the game, as he is very hard to kill and able to instantly kill most infantry and cavalry units with his mace. More powerful units, such as Trolls and Ents are still no match for him in small amounts, being easily killed by a few blows of his mace. Sauron is also able to summon fiery rocks from the skies and demoralize enemy units, causing them to run around in panic. When Sauron is killed, he explodes violently, heavily damaging any enemy units in the vicinity. Upon his death, he drops the One Ring, which may be picked up to summon another Ring Hero.

    Sauron, disguised as Annatar, with the newly-forged One Ring  
In the 2014 Middle-earth: Shadow of Mordor video game, Sauron appears before Celebrimbor as Annatar, the Lord of Gifts, and deceives him into creating the Rings of Power. After the secret forging of the One Ring, Annatar takes Celebrimbor to Mordor to pefect the One Ring. Celebrimbor later escapes Mordor with the Ring and uses its power to challenge Sauron into battle. At the last moment, the Ring slips from Celebrimbor's finger. As vengeance, Sauron transforms back into Annatar and proceeds to kill Celebrimbor.
In the 2017 sequel to the above, Middle-earth: Shadow of War, he ends up fighting Celebrimbor despite still being weakened by the loss of the One Ring. Despite putting up a good fight, he is overwhelmed by Celebrimbor and his new host Eltariel planning on dominating him with the power of their own New Ring. Before succumbing, he cuts off Eltariel's ring finger like Isildur had done to him years earlier, and consumed Celebrimbor's wraith. While he survives, this forces him into a new form; a burning eye at the top of Barad-dûr, locked in a battle of wills with the elf until the One Ring is destroyed decades later.

Sauron appears in both LEGO The Lord of the Rings: The Video Game and LEGO The Hobbit: The Video Game; in the first he is a boss and playable character while he is featured as a playable character in the latter. His boss form appears as a massive CCBS figure-similar to something from LEGO's Knights Kingdom line, while as a playable character he appears as a minifigure. In The Hobbit game he appears in both Necromancer and fiery armored forms. The first game also features an Annatar minifigure as a downloadable character.

Sauron's minifigure form, voiced by Steven Blum, also appears in LEGO Dimensions, where he invades DC Comics' Metropolis and later engages the player in a battle atop a Doctor Who Dalek flying saucer; upon defeat he is banished back to the domain of primary game antagonist Lord Vortech and does not appear again.

In The Lord of the Rings: Conquest, Sauron is a playable character.

 Other media 
Sauron also appears or is referenced in a number of works that are not direct adaptations of The Lord of the Rings or it's associated mythos:

Sauron of Marvel Comics adopted the name in homage to the Tolkien character.[17]
Sauron served as the inspiration for the My Little Pony: Friendship is Magic antagonist King Sombra in his initial appearance.[18]
In The LEGO Batman Movie, Sauron-in his flaming eye form atop his tower-is among the villains recruited by The Joker to aid in his conquest of Gotham City. His powers of vision prove quite a nuisance to Batman and his companions, but he is eventually inadvertently destroyed by the Kraken's mouth projectile. He is here voiced by actor Jemaine Clement.

 Trivia 
He is one of only three characters to appear in all six films of both The Hobbit and The Lord of the Rings trilogies, the other two being Gandalf and Galadriel.
